Some weeks later  2 separate envelopes of cards arrived  both with the wrong initial and with some details of the address incorrect. I speak clearly  slowly an without a strong accent. I rung the card people a couple of weeks ago and asked for a correctly made out replacement. It has yet to arrive. Hardly efficient.					2016-09-30T22:12:18+0000	1475273538	2016-10-01 00:12:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Although we got it sorted I just wanted to say how lovely the Tesco staff were. They offered me a cup of tea and a seat to wait for the AA to arrive. And once my car started one of the ladies offered to drive behind me to make sure I was safe! They all were lovely and very kind to me when I was in a panic. Thank you all very much x					2016-09-30T22:03:59+0000	1475273039	2016-10-01 00:03:59	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Have been a loyal customer for years and spend hundreds of pounds a month on online food shopping. Ordered my shopping on wed night to be delivered with the new saver delivery slot (6pm-10pm). Was due to arrive thursday night. 10pm and no shopping arrived....11pm and no shopping arrived. Husband Finally went to bed at 11.30pm as had work the next day. I called the helpline at 7am and was given no reason or explanation as to why my £255 food shop had not arrived. I was told it could no be guarenteed to be delivered today! I tried to cancel the order to be told would take 3-5 days to go back into my account. Not acceptable so i agreed to wait for a redelivery. Got £20 voucher when i asked for complaints department! I was on night shift... so got up at 5pm with a text to say will be delivered between 7-8pm. I left for work at 7.30pm and still no sign. Hubby called me and said it arrived at 20:15pm and 21 items are beyond use by date tomorrow and two are actually use by today!!!!!! Total cost £35!!! Oh and i got my £1 delivery refunded and a £5 gift card!!!!!! The driver apparently ran out of time!!! What a mess!!!! Any suggestions what i do with my £35 worth of food that needs eaten tomorrow?? Surely i should have been a priority to deliver on time today. Very disappointed Tesco :(					2016-09-30T21:36:49+0000	1475271409	2016-09-30 23:36:49	0	2	0	3	5	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After watching my 3 year old try to escape the trolley she asked for his help with scanning my shopping to keep him occupied.  Also  thank you to the lady who bought the chocolates round.  I didn t catch your name but it let me get the last couple of aisles sorted before check out!

Staff were clearing out bread from bakery into pink coloured bags  can t remembered extract wording on them but basically stating not suitable for consumption??  Why is it that bread baked this morning  lunchtime or whenever today not suitable to be eaten tonight or tomorrow.  Am shocked. Someone going to bed tonight with an empty stomach will happily eat that tomorrow. I know I would cos I do. Why is it acceptable to only donate food that has long life. I am sure a shelter or another organisation that helps those in need wouldn t mind them  for sandwiches or breakfast tomorrow of dunk in a soup?Absolute waste. Am quite disgusted.					2016-09-30T20:46:25+0000	1475268385	2016-09-30 22:46:25	0	10	0	0	10	10	3	7	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Went into my local Tesco express  (Dagenham oxlow lane) to quickly grab a can of dog food. When I got home to give the dog food to my dog I noticed the pull top on the lid was missing.  On closer inspection of the tin. Some one has previously tried to open the can. You can clearly see by the pictures that someone has taken a tin opener to it. Quite shocking that this tin has made it back onto the shelf!!!! I can t take it back as the cashier asked me if I would like a receipt as I was in a rush I said I d be ok with out one. A mistake I won t be making again!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14469662_10154640288062042_1614322166939437643_n.jpg?oh=af8fdaac3c4107b2d76422a88f4cf1ac&oe=59207BD1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14469662_10154640288062042_1614322166939437643_n.jpg?oh=d22a371ec880f1ca5923d18bfaa1bac3&oe=58D66EDC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154640288062042&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-30T20:34:29+0000	1475267669	2016-09-30 22:34:29	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a ps4 500 gb after frantically trying to get one for an upcoming birthday and managed to pay for one online via the amazing deal.Too good to be true I asked myself. Maybe the gods were on my side! I paid online   had an order number and was collecting tomorrow . Then out of the blue this evening I receive an email saying item cancelled ??? In a panic I rang them . 19 minutes of my life I will never get back!!! 3 different   customer services managers later  each telling me to hold the line to be connected to a different dept   .(who is in charge of the managers that s what I want to know????? ) I get through to a rather unhelpful man . It s down to the website not updating stock . Then he blamed the suppliers. Then it was the website again. Really I replied most websites have a stock ordering system that states not in stock when it reaches zero. His reply was .well you would think so wouldn t you but the site is rubbish !!! I asked to go on the reserve list to which he replied they don t have one. Funny that as that is one of there options.... Then he said there s nothing more he could do ...  No help what so ever. I would like to know who is going to explain to the excited birthday boy that he s not getting his longed for gift ?????					2016-09-30T20:30:42+0000	1475267442	2016-09-30 22:30:42	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Rude  ignorant staff!!!   Hardly any tills open  lots of queues  so I join a queue only to have the till supervisor walk in front of me  shut the gate telling the cashier that she is now closed and totally blank me! Would it have cost her anything to mention to me that the till was being closed  or to close it after me  or even acknowledge that I was there!!  On the plus side  the finger that I caught in my trolley when I jumped back as she shut the gate in front of me  doesn t appear to be broken.					2016-09-30T18:49:37+0000	1475261377	2016-09-30 20:49:37	0	9	0	0	9	9	6	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It now appears that you can park free for 15minutes but if longer you must spend #5 on groceries  to be apply to park longer  as I sometimes go just for cigarettes it means that I must park walk to store  wait to be served and return to the car and exit within 15 minutes or there is a fine.  No thanks  I will buy them them elsewhere or pack up. Every little think helps					2016-09-30T18:31:20+0000	1475260280	2016-09-30 20:31:20	0	10	0	0	10	10	5	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The Amazing Exploding Sweeteners have struck one too many times. Twice in my kitchen last week. Once on the way to meet a friend for coffee  once  spectacularly  in my favourite coffee shop (that was yesterday and I m not sure when I ll be welcome back)  and tonight I ve had to clear up a hundred tiny little sweeteners so my nine month old baby doesn t get up in the morning and make himself poorly.

I ordered a ps4 500 gb after frantically trying to get one for an upcoming birthday and managed to pay for one online via the amazing deal.Too good to be true I asked myself. Maybe the gods were on my side! I paid online   had an order number and was collecting tomorrow . Then out of the blue this evening I receive an email saying item cancelled ??? In a panic I rang them . 19 minutes of my life I will never get back!!! 3 different   customer services managers later  each telling me to hold the line to be connected to a different dept   .(who is in charge of the managers that s what I want to know????? ) I get through to a rather obnoxious and unhelpful manager . It s down to the website not updating stock . Then he blamed the suppliers. Then it was the website again. Really I replied most websites have a stock ordering system that states not in stock when it reaches zero. His reply was .well you would think so wouldn t you but the site is rubbish !!! I asked to go on the reserve list to which he replied they don t have one. Funny that as that is one of there options.... Then he said there s nothing more he could do ...  No help what so ever. I would like to know who is going to explain to the excited birthday boy that he s not getting his longed for gift ?????					2016-09-30T18:12:08+0000	1475259128	2016-09-30 20:12:08	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When i tried to exchamge they said we cant exchange and im now concerned if i go back they will refuse again but surely not on this evidence.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14457547_991506597901_7157135251842484310_n.jpg?oh=3cc75399a7cc6257349dc9db386590ed&oe=591DA1DB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14457547_991506597901_7157135251842484310_n.jpg?oh=7b0654154c503ec3f1a03f266984be5e&oe=58D9249D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=991506597901&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-30T17:24:32+0000	1475256272	2016-09-30 19:24:32	0	12	2	0	14	11	5	6	2	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0

I will never  EVER  buy another Hudl again.					2016-09-30T17:09:09+0000	1475255349	2016-09-30 19:09:09	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

While visiting there today my grandfather s gold ring fell off my necklace  and I only realized upon returning home. However a member of staff had found said ring and was waiting for me to return after I had called. The ring as is  is nothing special but has a massive sentimental value to me as we lost him a while ago   and this is one of the few items I have to remember him by.  I do t know what I would of done if I lost it   so much love and any many thanks x					2016-09-30T16:02:50+0000	1475251370	2016-09-30 18:02:50	2	4	2	0	6	4	1	3	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I did go in there the previous  week for wellies too and they had none i always go Tesco first as local and easy but you seem to be serious neglecting  your clothing department in Ely store whats the point of offering a clothing section if it is. Not going to be serviced i think socks is a pretty basic thing! Unfortunately i didn t have my phone on me both time to take any pictures.

When it started to rain heavily I got invited to come and sit on a seat in a quite corner of the store. Thank you tesco lady  I really appreciated it. Never thought I would be able to say I have breastfed in the freezer section in Tesco.					2016-09-30T08:15:08+0000	1475223308	2016-09-30 10:15:08	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I purchased a large pork shoulder joint as I want to cook pulled pork for my family. The joint purchased weighed 1.765kg. The recipe states that you must trim the joint of fat. I have done this and I m staggered that nearly 400g of the joint is fat. This feels like a rip off.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14433159_10211075361946973_5991428726733544912_n.jpg?oh=77f781381224e5c9badb66883d72f3f3&oe=591A2600	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14433159_10211075361946973_5991428726733544912_n.jpg?oh=307cc238c539056f2443116b84d5d1c1&oe=5921670D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211075361946973&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-30T07:53:36+0000	1475222016	2016-09-30 09:53:36	1	2	3	0	5	2	1	1	2	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0

Tesco has decided to stop selling it? I can buy the small loaf but I don t want a small loaf. I can buy it in every other supermarket but yours and when I go to other supermarkets in end up buying my shopping from there which loses you money and loyalty.

I ordered a PS4 at midnight on the 29th  still awaiting dispatch. I ordered a PS4 controller at 4.30pm on the 29th which was dispatched this morning for collection tomorrow. So it looks like I will have a controller which is late and no console to play it on. I can t say that I m excited by this prospect.					2016-09-30T07:17:08+0000	1475219828	2016-09-30 09:17:08	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He didn t say hello or anything when I answered the door. He didn t offer to help with the shopping. I have a 2 year old daughter who loves it when tesco deliver as she loves to say hello to the drivers. Normally the drivers say hello and interact with my daughter. The driver last night completely ignored her calling out  hello tesco man  from our lounge repeatedly. He didn t even smile or look at her. I felt this was extremely rude and left my daughter confused as to why he hadn t said hello back. Lastly  he didn t have the little computer for me to sign as it was charging in his van. He said he would sign it for me!! I do not want anyone else signing something on my behalf. Now I know it s only for my shopping but that s not the point. I asked if he had some paper I could sign which he got out of his pocket along with a pen. Now his next action really left me feeling insulted - before he took the pen back he took a used tissue from his pocket in order to take the pen from me like he didn t want to to7ch something I had touched. Just felt rude to me. Overall really not impressed with the driver last night!					2016-09-30T06:54:39+0000	1475218479	2016-09-30 08:54:39	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco is the only place I can order with the the school logo as the local uniform shop only supply jumpers. We re this joy the case I d have long since given up as its pretty hopeless 😩 I ve even made phone calls to try and establish when stock would be available  and even suggested that Tesco takes some stock from elsewhere - I can order the exact same cardigan without school embroidery no problem at all! I find it astonishing that such a well established company like Tesco is unable to fulfill a simple supply and demand issue. For almost 7 weeks now you ve not had stock of the one item my daughter requires for school (in the correct size).

Out of the many fast drivers going past  he was the only person who came and helped us by pushing our car to the side of the road and offering all the support we could. I didn t catch his name or his lorry number but what a fantastic man he was. Again  I must say you have some fantastic staff members working for you and he further proved that to us tonight.

Would just like to say I was disappointed to find only the 28th September dates on your Cravendale Skimmed Milk at your Market Street  Manchester store tonight. The poor member of staff was embarrassed and went to see if you had any in date milk for me but didn t. Please keep an eye on the sell by dates for future reference.					2016-09-29T20:52:35+0000	1475182355	2016-09-29 22:52:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One beer bottle has leaked on everything - only discovered this after the driver had left (last time round it was cranberry juice- at least beer is washable).  I m now washing the shopping and mopping my hall floor. Once I can understand but twice in a row is shoddy. Ocado from now on.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14516327_10157523090205608_1070818032577885951_n.jpg?oh=16127b94c2dc87996afd5f5d81085043&oe=591A99E4	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14516327_10157523090205608_1070818032577885951_n.jpg?oh=e01869d24354d0ca857698f6c51d8249&oe=58DC30E9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157523090205608&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-29T20:10:27+0000	1475179827	2016-09-29 22:10:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went in to the electrical desk to ask if they had any PS4 consoles left at the reduced price. 1 man didnt even bother looking up just said  no  Ok fair enough he may of been asked that question lots of times today but abit of eye contact and more than a 1 word answer would of been nice. The other member of staff asked if it was the 500 or 1TB I was after  to which i said i really didnt mind my sons would be happy with either. Instead of saying sorry  we dont have any he replied with  ive took the last 1  its waiting out the back for me for when i finish  with a smug look on his face. If he would of just said no i would of been fine with that  fair enough ive missed out. I went to the customer service desk on the way out just to mention the absolutely disgusting customer service i recieved  Tavon listened to what i had to say then called a manager. Whilst waiting he asked if I would still like to purchase 1 if he checked the system to see what was left. Whilst waiting he dealt with another customer who had also come to complain about the same members of staff I had! Throughout the whole time he was dealing with us he was polite  smiling and went above and beyond to help sort the problem out. I got my sons their PS4 & i hope Tavon gets some recognition for his excellent customer service.					2016-09-29T19:13:02+0000	1475176382	2016-09-29 21:13:02	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I paid for my groceries (£7.10) using my credit card  it showed as accepted on the card machine and then flashed up  accepted  on the till computer screen so I started to walk off.  I happened to turn back round and noticed the checkout assistant looked a bit confused so I asked if everything was ok and she said that the system had frozen and no receipt had come out and that she would get her manager.  So along he comes and tells me that despite my payment being accepted  I d have to wait around 10 mins for him to check his back office system for the payment.  I explained that I was in a hurry and that I would leave my number and should there be any issues I would pop back in later and pay again.  Unfortunately this was a bit too straight forward and drama-free for him so he told me I would have to leave my purchases if I were to leave the shop.  Considering my payment had been accepted  I was not willing to leave behind what I had paid for and proceeded to leave the shop.  The male manager and another female member of staff then followed me out to my car trying to get my purchases off of me.  They were taking down my car registration details to call the police about my  theft  of Ryvita  bananas  ham  Philadelphia and Snackajacks at which point I again offered them my name  address and telephone number so they could contact me if there was indeed an issue but they didn t want this  only my registration number so they could call the police  which he started to do before I drove off.  Unsurprisingly  the police haven t been in touch about this trivial matter!    I am deeply disappointed in the treatment I received from the staff in this store (mainly the manager)  in no way was I trying to thieve my Ryvitas etc  in fact it was the store manager trying to steal lunch off of a very evidently pregnant woman!!  The payment hasn t shown up yet on my statement so if indeed the computer freeze caused the payment not to be processed then please do let me know and I will settle my debt ASAP!    Regards   Melanie Shanks					2016-09-29T19:11:23+0000	1475176283	2016-09-29 21:11:23	11	5	12	0	17	5	4	1	2	0	10	0	0	1	0	0	0

On Tue 27.09  was viciously attacked by Store manager (Andrew?) and his tatto-ed ally at Strood  for my kid having picked 2 apples and 2 mandarine (?) from FREE FRUITS STAND  both smallish sizes.  Branded me a thief repeatedly (!!!)  Pack with fruits was snatched (!!!) from my daughter s lap (she sat in the shopping trolley  small one  eating apple  after school)  Prior this - was hunted around shop(!!!) while (I) have not got a clue about  action  .They instigated other workers  lie in my face by saying staff  reported on me  (when I confronted  staff  they had not clue about it) When I confronted him about lie- he just turned back and left. I am sure his desire to  act  fuelled by my nationality. Investigation should be carried and appropriate action taken; logically- mirrored action of SM s misconduct- OVERREACT and BE BULLY  and UNDERMINE  and BELITTLE  HUNT him DOWN  INSTIGATE OTHERS  be UNFAIR.  Surely  DO NOT LISTEN anything coming from him- just TALK OVER him all over again with same phrases. During all time he will try to say something - just wear some lousy smile  mansplaining one. And all of this- in presents of their children  ideally- the one s  who cannot understand the situation but got so stressed that will cry all the way home and did not sleep well. You really have explanations to do  Tesco.					2016-09-29T18:54:11+0000	1475175251	2016-09-29 20:54:11	0	9	1	0	10	9	1	8	13	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

The pea leek and pancetta had one piece of 1cm leek (which naturally I gave to the enemy as it was a romantic evening) I followed the instructions on the choc melt pudding and it tasted stale.

I now have a unhappy 3 year old without a birthday present and me and mom are disappointed in your tesco direct service.					2016-09-29T12:16:32+0000	1475151392	2016-09-29 14:16:32	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was feeling extremely under the weather yesterday but had to go in to fill up with fuel after work. The lady in particular who s name I didn t get (blonde curly hair) made a simple gesture of kindness to me which completed made my day. She is a credit to your company and I appreciated her kindness yesterday after feeling so rubbishy.... Please could you ensure that her manager is informed and let her know that how grateful I was.					2016-09-29T12:11:39+0000	1475151099	2016-09-29 14:11:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst sympathetic to these people I was aware that it is a rare occurrence. Well you can imagine my shock when I opened my bananas from yourselves .to find as you can see in the picture below what only can be described as a man eating evil killer purple spider. Well you can imagine my upset and distress. So after I got over the initial shock I did what any good person  would do and grab a glass and a piece of paper to put outside the said spider.  As walked into the kitchen to grab these items I was attacked from behind by the evil spider wrapped up dozens of times  in its sticky web and pinned to the kitchen ceiling where I spent the next six hours unable  to talk or move.  Well this was distressing as I don t particularly like heights and I missed the new episode of jeremy kyle. I was only discovered by my children who came into kitchen wondering why I was not cooking food and they proceeded to cut me down using a chain saw and a Stanley  knife. As I fell to the kitchen  floor my first concern was where was the man eating spider.so I ran from the kitchen to find it legging it through my back garden over the six foot fence where it landed on the roof of the r4 bus and was last seen  hitching a ride up the lane.  Well I thought it was my duty to inform you of this as I am concerned about other members of the public and to let you know I was rather disappointed with the bananas.  But apart from that I think you guys are amazing.

However it will be difficult to use them as you have closed my local Tesco which is probably the reason you have missed me.  I was on holiday when it happened so I am afraid I wasn t in the area to say goodbye.  It s replacement does frustrate me though as it is a lesser quality OneStop which I appreciate is part of the Tesco Group but it s not the same  especially as a siren goes off every time you walk passed the door as well as when you walk through it.  I do thank you though for your concern and that you have missed me  although I am sure we will both agree it s your fault (Tesco not the person necessarily reading this) I m not shopping there any more.  I can confirm though that I am healthy and well.  Hopefully our paths will cross again  maybe if I am in a City where you decide you want build a Tesco.    I have included a picture below of the beautiful village of Bilbrook in South Staffordshire where you were once based  I hope this may entice you back here as we too have missed you.  Sadly as I am not on the Parish  District or County Council I cannot offer you any more of an incentive.  Take care and all the best in the future.  Your Missed Customer Andrew	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14440822_10154090796381379_8012232457547042455_n.jpg?oh=8fca7d335da268f8aff369226a7bb471&oe=5924954A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14440822_10154090796381379_8012232457547042455_n.jpg?oh=658f9d2b740da5e59c19e0d978d03b72&oe=59205BAC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154090796381379&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-29T10:04:15+0000	1475143455	2016-09-29 12:04:15	27	2	34	0	36	2	2	0	9	0	27	1	0	6	0	0	0

My name is Mandy and I m a tesco quark addict.   I am afraid that I am not yet ready to step into rehabilitation for his addiction and therefore it needs to be fed! Much to my great distress it appears that tesco quark is out of stock in all my local tesco stores 😭. I am a slimming world member and so far since January 2016 have lost nearly 7 stone both on my own and with the help of slimming world. I can quite confidently say that being able to eat lovely tesco quark by the bucket load has been crucial in my weight loss journey.   Please please can you tell me how long it will be before I can feed my addiction again ?

I think her name was Janice who was working in the toy section last night (Wed 28th). She was so helpful in helping me down to the checkout with some toys from your excellent sale and keeping them there for me so I didn t have to carry them round the store.  I noticed her chatting to other customers and giving great customer service while also working hard to get more toys out all with a smile on her face. I hope I ve got her name right and she gets some kind of recognition from the store manager. Great to see great customer service like this in a busy store it also made me buy more as I didn t have to carry so much round the store. 😁					2016-09-29T06:23:09+0000	1475130189	2016-09-29 08:23:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firstly  I think it s a great idea. But. Last night at about 7.40 I went to use the machine  it has a very bright display screen and no external light around it. It took a while to go through the process of picking my car  etc.  When I d finished I stepped away and could see a thing for a brief moment  because my eyes were going from such extreme brightness to darkness.  This panicked me a little and i stopped walking.  After the 2/3 seconds it took for my eyes to adjust I realised there was someone else stood looking at me. Waiting to use the machine.  This frightened me. Please can this be be addressed in terms of some extra external lighting.  Due to working hours I don t use the store during the day  but this has put me off going there at night.  Tell trouble is. For two weeks the lighting at the great notley store car park hasn t worked!					2016-09-29T06:05:21+0000	1475129121	2016-09-29 08:05:21	1	4	1	0	5	4	1	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was luck because if I was a couple of steps closer I would of got hit with some kind of debree from the sign bits flew all over the place something hit my face but left no marks.. but I have to say it was very dangerous and made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe the staff at your store took mine and another ladies details I would like to think that they pass them on to you  The electric wire had snapped and was hanging off the sign..	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14479760_309815209390931_4048067240179531115_n.jpg?oh=377599769339a91c3699836250e99693&oe=58EF5CD8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14479760_309815209390931_4048067240179531115_n.jpg?oh=47558f26ac9410aeb05b4c8aa4b8eb21&oe=58DA2F27	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=309815209390931&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-28T23:41:21+0000	1475106081	2016-09-29 01:41:21	1	5	2	0	7	4	3	1	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

However  I would love to express my gratitude and take a moment to praise both Peter Mitchell and Alex McKenzie of the Tesco Direct Customer Services Team.  Peter has been helping me over the past three weeks and Alex has helped me tonight and I am in amazement due to them going out of their way to help  doing above and beyond what their job entails them to do and just being lovely.  It was my daughter s Birthday a few weeks ago and the one thing she asked for was the Club Petz Lucy Interactive doll. Not cheap for what it is at £40 but Tesco had it reduced at £24. I bought it back in May or June ready for September.  On opening it for her Birthday  I then went to set it up for her to find it wasn t working. Assuming it was faulty  I sent an email to Tesco explaining I d had it for a few months but it had only just been opened and Peter emailed me back offering me a refund or a replacement. Being a much wanted toy  I went for a replacement and a new Lucy arrived the next day.  Again  unfortunately  Lucy didn t work  and so I replied again and Peter got back to me. He offered me  as before  a replacement or a refund if I d lost confidence in the toy  and I chose to give Lucy one more shot  and the next day Lucy #3 arrived.  As expected  but whilst trying to be optimistic  Lucy didn t work. I emailed again but asked this time if I could have a refund so that my little girl could buy something else with the money.  Before  my emails had been saved for Peter to reply to but this time Alex replied.  He explained that he had processed my refund and that  as usual  it would take 3-5 days to go into my account.  He also told me that he had sent my daughter a  little gift  due to Lucy not having worked  and included the catalogue number in case I wanted to have a look.  That  little gift  was a large Disney Princess doll and tea party set which costs pretty much the same much as Lucy did at £40 rrp  now £20 on sale.  To say I am surprised as it was so unexpected is an understatement.  I am so grateful and I know my daughter is going to be so amazed and love her so  so much.  As well as all of that  both Peter and Alex have wished my little one a Happy Birthday and Alex has asked how she is after I apologised for a delay in emailing due to her being unwell.  They both have gone above and beyond to help me and I have never had such a helpful and happy outcome to an unfortunate issue before.  Well done Peter and Alex.  Your work hasn t gone unnoticed or unappreciated.  X					2016-09-28T22:03:57+0000	1475100237	2016-09-29 00:03:57	5	3	6	0	9	3	2	1	0	0	5	1	0	0	0	0	0

I was really surprised when I saw this children s top in the Clacton store the other day. I m not sure that somebody is fully aware of all the connotations of the phrase  Grow Angel Wings . It s a phrase used regularly by ladies who have lost a baby or child. It s often said  Too beautiful for earth  they grew their angel wings  I m sure the designer didn t mean it this way but even so  it would be quite distressing for some : -(	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q84/s130x130/14457284_10208660238518261_1288659760517808305_n.jpg?oh=ee6e12562d4b3ede2848cac94e5f34cc&oe=5919864C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q84/s720x720/14457284_10208660238518261_1288659760517808305_n.jpg?oh=7a82725010ded19554cf3b9487486c1a&oe=58E27BA0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208660238518261&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-28T21:17:34+0000	1475097454	2016-09-28 23:17:34	0	5	2	0	7	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0

He was sitting in a trolley when a small slither of metal got stuck in his thumb. I just want to praise the staff Gillian and Chris who dealt with it amazingly. My little boy is usually terrified of strangers and both staff where extremely patient with him and the first aider Chris got the metal out in one try. Cannot fault their customer service. Nothing was too much trouble from either of them and Gillian (who is management of some sort) even gave my son a little gift for being super brave. Top service Tesco! 👍👍					2016-09-28T20:10:21+0000	1475093421	2016-09-28 22:10:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am not one to normally praise Tesco and I guess here I am not really. The praise goes to a thoughtful  caring  kind and considerate employee at one of your stores.  Tesco on the Dedworth Rd in Windsor. Within here works a certain individual whom most staff would learn from.  This member of staff overheard me saying that it was my son s first outing since having complex surgery. Not the most exhilarating of places but it proved to be a trip he nor I will ever forget.  This employee asked her management if my son would be eligible for a store gift voucher as a special treat after what he had been through and as a thanks from Tesco as they want to say thank you to their customers. We are the kind of family who do not have much luck but this employee has made my son s life have a glimmer of happiness due to her person. Thank you to Rachel Appleton who has worked for Tesco for many years according to her name badge as my son saw. You should train your staff based upon her workings.					2016-09-28T19:23:08+0000	1475090588	2016-09-28 21:23:08	39	18	40	2	60	18	14	4	29	0	39	1	0	0	0	0	0

( I m wheat gluten and dairy intolerant.  😢) the first one was great   4 of them is all I could handle!!  I couldn t finish the packet. The flavouring is so powerful it made me feel sick. I could taste garlic for days and my hubby wasn t impressed?! This isn t a complaint but giving my opinion on flavour. I love the fact your range is expanding you may even steal me from sainsburys!! All I ask is look in to your garlic quantity in these Crisps and may be look at your pricing for all of your free from range. I understand the food has a more complicated process but all set up costs /process costs should of been covered by now. I m sure us freedom people would spend more if the costs were lower.   Oh thank you so much for the freefrom cocoa pops you now sell. They are one of my favourites 😀 ( sadly they will only be brought as my birthday treat because they only last for 2/3 breakfast portions!!)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14502706_10157517413005430_5681490496851804391_n.jpg?oh=92fa03cd9acf803167f47fdb170e8959&oe=58EEA86E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14502706_10157517413005430_5681490496851804391_n.jpg?oh=5331cdb79d13eb4317714df7da61fdb8&oe=591A4163	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157517413005430&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-28T19:20:16+0000	1475090416	2016-09-28 21:20:16	1	2	1	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought an Amazon fire from you for my son at the end of December last year & there seems to be an issue with the charging point. We initially thought it was the Chargers  however after going through 4 chargers we have noticed a bit inside the charging point looks loose. What is your policy on this please? We no longer have the receipt. Purchased from your Clifton Moor  York branch on 28th December.					2016-09-28T18:29:01+0000	1475087341	2016-09-28 20:29:01	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Guy shows up at 4  I m a little bit early (an hour) but it gets you done dunnit?  I wonder if he genuinely thought I was grateful for being able to  get done  as I try to stop my screaming toddler from running out into the street to follow a dog she saw whilst simultaneously trying to empty a crate whilst totally not hiding my unimpressed face.   I ve complained about this several times to your costumers services before eventually putting it in my delivery notes to not come early. It usually automatically puts it in the notes now but I guess it stopped when we moved house a few weeks ago so that ll be going back on. I always answer it as well because when they come THAT early I just assume I must have booked the wrong slot.   The guy was lucky he had brought some of my daughter s favourite crisps or there would have been hell to pay. 👍					2016-09-28T15:34:28+0000	1475076868	2016-09-28 17:34:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Monday morning  as I was making lunchboxes  I realised the chicken had a use by date of 26 september.. that same day!! I purchased the big packet so how on earth was I suppose to use it all in one day?! Its the 28th now and Ive just found out the beef mince  which I was just about to cook for my familys dinner  had a use by date of 26 september aswell! not happy at all. Maybe I should look more carefully but I should have trust and faith in your shops that Im not throwing my money in the bin! Perhaps a warning in the form of a sticker on the item that it has a short use by date!!					2016-09-28T14:41:00+0000	1475073660	2016-09-28 16:41:00	1	3	1	0	4	3	3	0	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every time I shop there is less and less of a value range or you have increased the prices by 50%. Im a full time student on a very tight budget who is now getting to the point that I cannot shop in your stores. I understand you are introducing you new fake farm ranges however do you not realise by increasing the pricess by as much as you have and reducing your value range you are putting yourself out of people budgets and they are going to shop elsewhere? I would love to know your thoughts on this. thanks Kelly					2016-09-28T13:54:56+0000	1475070896	2016-09-28 15:54:56	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

I am holding a Mayoral masquerade charity ball on 12th November 2016. I am hoping to hold a raffle on the night of my event  the proceeds going to LUKE’S FUND. Luke Davies  is 14 years old  born and bred in Rhuddlan  where his family live. On new years eve this year  Luke suffered a spinal stroke  which is very rare in adults  but virtually unheard of in children  which has left him paralysed from the neck down. I would be very grateful if you could donate a prize    the better the prize the more money we can hopefully raise  which would also be fantastic publicity for your company. Thanking you in anticipation.  Town Councillor Sara-Jane King Mayor of Rhuddlan					2016-09-28T13:15:31+0000	1475068531	2016-09-28 15:15:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I run an after school club so everything has to run on time. My manager called me at 18.10 to tell me Tesco hasn t arrived  i came back to the club to let my staff go home as i was now paying them over time for the  lateness. I called Tesco and waited 10 min before an answer. still at this time I had heard nothing from either the driver or Tesco about the delay. Once Tesco had answered my call i had a lovely lady on the other side of the phone. She called the driver   who replied he was running late and couldn t see how far down i was on the list! she said the driver estimated he d be 10 min. this is at 18.40. I mentioned to the lady  on the phone it had to be by 6 50 as a yoga class was about to be set up. the driver asked the call assistant where to go once at the school. i heard the conversation and explained to pass school and go to the field. I waited and waited. the yoga class arrived  my meeting was about to start in the next village  and  i hadn t been home to see my children. I went out to the school road at 19 07 to see if i could see the Tesco van  I saw the Van and the driver. he had disturbed the school who to were having a meeting  Obversely  not listening to the directions given. He followed me to where i had told him originally to go. He then continued to be loud while unloading the shopping. the yoga class was trying to have a class! So My shopping arrived late  no info about the delay. I missed my meeting my 15 minutes. i didn t see my children and I had to pay my staff for over time! Is this right. is this how you d like to be spoken about? I have emailed Tesco and thePperson who relpied to me offered my £5 evoucher. I m sorry but the whole inconvenience cost me a lot more then that. I am a very appointed customer     .					2016-09-28T12:45:31+0000	1475066731	2016-09-28 14:45:31	0	4	0	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s sunny here  but man is it windy. Anyway  now that the British style formalities of talking about the weather are done with I was hoping you might be able to answer a fairly straight forward question in relation to the world of digital sports...   You may have heard the Electronic Arts are releasing a certain  popular football game tonight/tomorrow  the 29th day of September  known as FIFA 17. My question is thus: will Fifa be available from midnight at your 24 hour stores? and as a cheeky follow up (I know I promised one question but I am taking liberties as you ve already read this far) do you know how much it will be on the PS4 and Xbox One platforms?  Many thanks in advance of your lovely response  Ryan					2016-09-28T12:15:12+0000	1475064912	2016-09-28 14:15:12	3	6	3	0	9	6	1	5	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

After trying to find something to reattached it  one of your HGV drivers called Kyle  saw me struggling and came across to help. I wanted to thank him once again for his help and for the directions to the nearest garage. He was my knight in shining amour as I have no clue about cars!

Not happy with the response from customer services  (it use to be very good at responding).	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14520499_10154448743801605_5514758891535730140_n.jpg?oh=6afafa8de1a59ac2b4ab460d8f60bcdd&oe=591CFB6D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14520499_10154448743801605_5514758891535730140_n.jpg?oh=001663eef22fce2d2535f373a1164c25&oe=58E86B60	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154448743801605&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-28T11:29:16+0000	1475062156	2016-09-28 13:29:16	0	1	0	1	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is all because one of the self service till wasn t working properly and I simply ask should the not turn it off. I had to ask this question three time before being told no they weren t going to turn the machine off.  After both of the staff member watch me scan half my items before informing me it wasn t working correctly.The attitude one of the worst I have ever experienced. I am so disappointed.These member of staff completely let your store down this morning					2016-09-28T10:47:18+0000	1475059638	2016-09-28 12:47:18	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 3 year old son threw up in my car this morning as I was getting petrol.  I ran in to the shop to pay and buy some wipes. The ladies gave me blue roll to help clean up and while I was sorting him out Kelly came and put cones around my car and told me to take my time helping him. She came back out again a minute later with carrier bags  more blue roll and a drink of water for my little boy. She chatted and reassured him while I wiped up my car quickly. The other lady then came out with more carrier bags and offered to help sort out the rubbish.  They both made a stressful situation much easier for me and my little one and I wanted to thank them again. Not many people would go out of their way like they did and we both really appreciated it. Thank you Kelly and colleague xxx					2016-09-28T10:18:32+0000	1475057912	2016-09-28 12:18:32	136	35	148	2	185	34	19	15	44	0	135	12	0	0	0	0	0

You really need to take a look at what your competitors charge  such as Asda. I usually use Asda mainly because their delivery fees are reasonable and I rarely pay more than £2  even at peak times. To save even more money  I now pay for a delivery pass at £5 a month for any slot I want. If you think about  you want MORE money for one delivery  than Asda charge me for unlimited deliveries for an entire month!!!

So there I was  preparing to enjoy some of your tasty raspberries for a healthier tasty breakfast. I was chomping down on the delicious fruity goodness thinking life  and Tesco  was pretty sweet.  But alas this good time train was coming to an end before the journey had really got going. As I forked around at the berries  I noticed something else prodding back. My heart stopped  my jaw dropped  and my eyes grew wide. Horror gripped me by the throat as I saw Phillip moving around among my berry treats.  I m not sure if Phillip s a maggot or caterpillar  but I do know he doesn t have any place in my pack of raspberries. So now  poor Phillip and I have had our mornings ruined.  He s been taken from his friends and family to wake up to my face screaming at him  and I ve had to see him wriggling about in my food. Now I m hungry and horrified and poor Phillip has no idea what s going on.  Needless to say  we re both looking for answers. Why was Phillip in my berries  why wasn t he scooped out and left home with his family and what s going to be done about the hunger I ve been left with 😞  #answersforphillip	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14502967_1469739783042567_7200745920010618981_n.jpg?oh=8b722f9b41cd3b8029aaca0595dc653b&oe=58D803D1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14502967_1469739783042567_7200745920010618981_n.jpg?oh=c873f5b7d19bcd8d2657dbd6300a2c9e&oe=58DB8FBA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1469739783042567&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-28T09:54:35+0000	1475056475	2016-09-28 11:54:35	31	14	42	2	58	14	7	7	52	0	29	0	0	11	0	0	0

I thought I was getting the drive in the red box as shown. I in fact got a HDD in the green box. I see now the price has suddenly jumped to £60. Is Tesco then now shipping the Toshiba HDD in the red box as per the description  or still shipping the HDD in green box? If shipping the green boxed HDD that is an error  because people will be paying over the odds.

It used to be good for if you needed any clothing basics etc as well as groceries  some of the stuff was actually quite nice. Sadly this store closed :(   I needed some women s clothing basics and I tried to add them to my online shop but I don t think it would let me do it.  Seems to me that you could include the option of people adding these items to their grocery shop  as they would in real life if they were walking around a large Tesco.  I wanted the items to arrive with my groceries.  Would ve saved me a trip!  Please consider my suggestion if this can t be done already :)					2016-09-28T01:18:20+0000	1475025500	2016-09-28 03:18:20	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In case you don t check local reviews on pages thought I d screen shot to you and post.

Bought this milk from your Aylesbury broadfield store on the evening of 26/09/16. Put it in my fridge as soon as I got home  only had maybe 10 minutes out of the fridge from your store to my house.   My daughter still drinks milk in the early hours so I came downstairs about  4am and poured this disgusting milk into my daughters bottle! I always leave it dark downstairs so that she doesn t wake fully. Luckily I heard the lumps of curdled milk hit the bottom of the bottle and immediately tipped it down the sink. Can you imagine if I hadn t and my 13 month old had drunk this???   As you can see from the photos the use by date is 01/10/16. Im my experience it should not look like this 3 days before its use by.   Please see attached photos. I look forward to your response.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14494862_10154404218466399_8767637294285997788_n.jpg?oh=6fa59321fc435abfc905cda826d36847&oe=58DE7A41	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14494862_10154404218466399_8767637294285997788_n.jpg?oh=35dd7862921ff6706eb65800836bd5c5&oe=591DB94C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154404218466399&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-27T22:01:04+0000	1475013664	2016-09-28 00:01:04	0	1	6	0	7	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	6	0

There is constantly rubbish around from the overflowing bin on weekends. Despite the bin gets emptied on Mondays  the rubbish never gets cleaned. There are Tesco plastic bags   Tesco food containers  Tesco receipts all over the street block and attaching buildings. I  have complained to the assistant manager on Monday   but the rubbish never got cleaned. Your store should take   the full responsibility in cleaning not just the storefront  as there is Tesco rubbish all around. It is shameful and embarrassing to live around this.

I was in one of your Tesco express this afternoon. I tried to use a visa credit card which needs a signature which I have already done several times in the same shop. And your staff told me that  only Tesco credit card can be used if signature is needed. Is that true?					2016-09-27T20:44:35+0000	1475009075	2016-09-27 22:44:35	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Following a rather traumatic 25 minute shower which is how long it took to soak / pull off my wound dressings  I can now honestly say that your low adherent dressings  advertised as being  non stick   have less Teflon properties in them than a piece of cardboard.   As if the super sized wound I was treating was not enough of a concern for me   I am now further back than square one as any nicely formed fresh skin I had managed to generate from being covered up today has been stripped away by the dressings.   Now I am a loyal Tesco shopper and not normally one to make public any little niggles I have  but this has caused me a lot of pain that I really didn t need. Admittedly I had used another brand as well as yours and the other was as equally non-Teflon like  however  nowhere on the other brand s packet did it state  non stick .  Not a happy shopper today!! I expect more from you!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14516552_10154581147709252_680241368247268894_n.jpg?oh=d3471d41c07f768341beda049978a1ec&oe=591E2DC5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14516552_10154581147709252_680241368247268894_n.jpg?oh=21952e9c51c44a1124b23d392242261c&oe=591ADFD0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154581147709252&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-27T20:21:22+0000	1475007682	2016-09-27 22:21:22	4	19	7	0	26	19	7	12	19	0	4	0	0	0	3	0	0

It s probably just the Risca store that is a problem but everytime I buy from Tesco I get mild food poisoning. I buy the same product from other stores and I m fine. Twice I ve bought a rice dessert that was a week out of date and every time I ve bought lactofree butter from there I ve been ill  bought the same product at asda and been fine. It seems to me that the before sales storage is not to standard  maybe the words dairy free or lactose free mean only refrigerate so the customer gets it cold at the Risca Tesco store. I refuse to buy anything there now even though it means I can no longer buy magazines.					2016-09-27T19:49:13+0000	1475005753	2016-09-27 21:49:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I made a complaint and she not only fed this back onto staff  but then within the hour came to my house with a bunch of flowers and a bottle of the wine I had just bought. She is a credit to your company  and should be recognised for her excellent customer service! Xxx					2016-09-27T19:37:30+0000	1475005050	2016-09-27 21:37:30	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Was told when I ordered the cleaner that delivery would be Saturday. 3.05pm Saturday we received an email saying order wouldn t be delivered like planned and that it would be delivered Monday instead.  Again  no delivery Monday. Even after countless attempts calling in the store and constantly checking the online tracking. Phoned up tesco direct Monday evening to be told that under no circumstances should this have happened and that it would be delivered today and guess what? No delivery today either.  I have contacted Tesco direct twice today and I ve been fed utter nonsense by staff on the phone with no explanation as to where my parcel has gone and now I ve been told that if there s no sign of it tonight I will be contacted in the morning to sort out another delivery.  £100 cleaner gone walkabout  with no one knowing where it s gone  no explanation for me at all only  it s on the van for delivery  which it has been on the van for delivery since 12.35 yesterday. So I can only assume it s coming from China?!  Absolutely disgusted and appalled.  Tesco are quick enough to take payment from my bank account but not so quick to chase my issue up.					2016-09-27T18:57:44+0000	1475002664	2016-09-27 20:57:44	3	2	4	0	6	2	1	1	0	0	3	1	0	0	0	0	0

Today you ve implemented a car parking system to prevent people  abusing  the free parking facility  I don t object to that  but the system you ve brought in  is to say the least CRAZY!! To get free parking you now have to get an extra receipt when paying for your items (£5 minimum spend) then after exiting the store you have to find the machines located outside in the rain/hail/snow/sleet/wind  to firstly enter the last 3 digits of your car reg then find & select the image of your vehicle amongst at least 8 that are shown on the screen  then the extra receipt received at the checkout has to be scanned  but of course that doesn t work  so you have to fudge around to find reading glasses to manually enter the code  all of this while trying to hold a bag of shopping that you ve just bought & don t want to put down on the wet ground as its a hessian reusable bag!!! This is just my story of a visit to Tesco today and what it will be like from now on with winter almost upon us  for mums with screaming children & a trolley full of shopping it certainly isn t going to be fun!! I ve spoken to Julie Ashcrof duty manager  since I returned home but she couldn t give any real reason as to why most importantly the machines are located externally  other than an outside company is responsible for the setup . Come on you re going to tell me Mr Tesco had no input in this. Tesco you ve failed miserably in implementing something that could & should have been so simple - have some sense & have a rethiink. For me it s out of town shopping for my groceries now!!					2016-09-27T16:42:45+0000	1474994565	2016-09-27 18:42:45	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was given a delivery slot of between 11&12. So far  so good. Had a missed call at around 11.30 when I was seeing to my son so I called back and there was no answer. Around 12.45  I called Tesco to see where it was and my delivery was the last on a route and had been returned! There wasn t a knock at the door or anything so I wasn t happy. They said I would be called back within an hour. So i didn t seem too pushy I left it an hour and half before I phoned back. I was passed through to someone at the Bradford store (which was unprofessionally done because the man thought he was still speaking to customer services). He had just come on shift and nothing had been done about my order. He asked me to leave it with him and he would call me back within 10 minutes  he had to check the routes and see if anyone could get my shopping delivered to me. 3 minutes later  he called and said he had someone to deliver my shopping and they would be doing so in half an hour (usual time it takes to get from Bradford to my home). Half an hour later  my shopping turned up so a massive thank you to James from the Bradford store and the delivery driver who picked up the job (sorry  I didn t get your name) You turned a negative experience (first one from tesco) into a positive one and deserve a big pat on the back!					2016-09-27T16:25:27+0000	1474993527	2016-09-27 18:25:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was at the Norham Road store in North Tyneside this morning when a man had a suspected heart attack and crashed his car. I just wanted to say how outstanding the staff were. They leapt to his aid and started resuscitating him. Helped calm all the witnesses and provided tea/coffee/food if needed. They also did an excellent job assisting the police with diverting traffic. I just wanted you to know they deserve recognition. Thank you to all of them.					2016-09-27T16:25:06+0000	1474993506	2016-09-27 18:25:06	3	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I reported the theft to @metpoliceuk but they need the CCTV footage ASAP. Please ask your Manager store 3068 on the corner of High Street/Royston Road  Beckenham to get this footage to the Police. The Met have had to close the file as they need the CCTV.   I ve just had an unpleasant meeting with her where I requested that she please help the Police but she literally refused to speak with me and walked off. I couldn t believe it.

From tesco.....ordered well in time for his birthday.  Lovely email 23rd September stating ready to collect.  Fantastic  awesome service.....decided to leave collection till the last minute to avoid prying eyes of darling son.  Go to collect this morning....get told it s not arrived and must still be waiting to be booked in.....explain 4 days is a tad long for booking in but various searches result in no xbox and late for work.  No phone call from store as promised so cue quick call to customer service to find out its actually been collected???!??!  Not anyone with my I d or card or email seeing as I m the only one with those  and I don t it... promises of cctv checking and  granted  as promised a call back from customer service promising the store would call back by 2pm.  Bearing in mind I have my sons birthday and no actual present to give him cos apparently it s been given someone else???? 2pm has come.....no call from store....no birthday present for my son  an angry boss due to the time spent trying to sort this and an even angrier mum who has been let down on probably the most important purchase she has to make each year.					2016-09-27T13:05:04+0000	1474981504	2016-09-27 15:05:04	0	14	1	0	15	14	10	4	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Cannot complain to any one at tescos any more because you cannot ever get hold of some that can deal with it!  If it s about food it s one department If it s about food and the process and time wasting idiotic staff member the you ve had it as they cannot deal with both.  You cannot complain about anything without getting three people from three departments on the phone at the same time to take a complaint!  Sort it out Tesco this is beyond a joke !	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14519943_10209127638642094_2371112487724552136_n.jpg?oh=27dd088370c0bfb4af641aaa1dfea55a&oe=58D74A6F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14519943_10209127638642094_2371112487724552136_n.jpg?oh=495ff7a975db242499870b9abf745c91&oe=58E89F62	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209127638642094&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-27T12:39:51+0000	1474979991	2016-09-27 14:39:51	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Until just recently this was a service that I thought was really good value for money.  My shopping gets picked and delivered from the Kingston store in Milton Keynes and recently the service has been really unacceptable.  I usually buy 5 days worth of meals and other household items per order. Often there is lots of  fresh meat  fruit  vegetables and various chilled items.  The issue recently has been the shelf life of my ordered items. At best there is usually 1 item that is  use by  the date of delivery and at worst there has been 5 items  use by  date of delivery. The delivery drivers inform me that this should never happen and if there is a short shelf life  it should be highlighted on the receipt to give you the option of sending it back. This is not happening. With pretty much every order over the last 10 weeks I have had to ring up to complain and then get a refund. I then have to go to a Tesco shop to replace the items which takes up my time and uses fuel. I have already paid £69 to have my shopping delivered so this really isn t proving very cost effective. The customer service department on the telephone have been very good. Refunding me for the items and emailing the Kingston store with my feedback. They have even requested (several times) that my shopping be audited to stop this happening. It hasn t worked  in fact it has got worse. The home delivery manager from Kingston did  telephone me to arrange redelivery of some food and when I asked her why my shopping wasn t being audited  she replied  well it will be now!  and told me she had to go.  My shopping clearly isn t being audited and to honest I am pretty fed up with the Kingston stores attitude. I would like this matter to be looked into further as I think the problems aren t just with the pickers  clearly the managers need some feedback too and policies need to be changed. I will not be renewing my delivery saver package this year and would in fact like my fee for the last 12 months refunded.  Also I will no longer be shopping with Tesco which means I won t buy food  fuel  clothes  anything from Tesco direct and we will be transferring the balance from our Tesco credit card to another provider. There has been more than enough opportunity to get things right but it simply hasn t happened for whatever reason and I do not feel valued as a loyal customer. It appears to me that once you have my money the customer service can go out of the window! I have posted this complaint today on social media as I want to be listened to and the complaint to be actioned. Hope to hear from you soon Kind regards  Sheryl					2016-09-27T11:36:04+0000	1474976164	2016-09-27 13:36:04	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I decided to go to self-service as I normally do  as I was scanning my first item the customer assistant came over very arrogantly and said you can ONLY have one person to a till  I relied why is this and she said because I said so. This was embarrassing and just dam right rude. I have been shopping there seen it opened and if that is how the staff are going to talk to you. I won t be going their again.					2016-09-27T11:16:54+0000	1474975014	2016-09-27 13:16:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I received in my mail an invitation to take part in a survey for Tesco.   This is not a genuine  at least I hope so  Tesco site.   If you go ahead and choose a (Free) gift.  you pay postage only  but  you are actually signing to receive the  product  and every month.  It will then cost you £75.  Be aware the invitation is misleading in information.  Not only that but the recurring charges are difficult to get out of.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14448898_1288428611176792_8251704805636095716_n.jpg?oh=aab0d28428570c9d4161e9b2928b40b0&oe=58EC47BF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14448898_1288428611176792_8251704805636095716_n.jpg?oh=0bb82aa9903717ab11fe5db5a04bf3e0&oe=58D710AA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1288428611176792&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-27T10:53:18+0000	1474973598	2016-09-27 12:53:18	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Although entertaining to watch her screaming down our office  she is now working on an empty tummy.

This morning took my lunch out the fridge only to see that the soup I got delivered last night is in fact 4 days out of date and is dated 22nd of September. Obviously I now have to go to the hassle of returning this to a store which is exactly what I wanted to avoid by doing shopping online!

There can be little doubt that  outside Italy  and with the exception of our local Italian restaurant  there is no finer supermarket Tiramisu than that sold by Tesco. I know. I have tried them all.  Our mainstay Monday night desert is usually a Tesco Tiramisu and  because it serves 6  we can normally stretch it to Tuesday and sometimes even Wednesday night if we are really pushed.  During the latter part of our recent pregnancy  we found the weekly shop (and the car warfare that followed) one ordeal too many so we opted for the  click and collect  service. It was then I became suspicious as  more often than not  our Tiramisu would arrive looking like it had travelled not from our local Tesco but all the way from Italy  possibly in the glove box of a white van capable of cornering at tremendous speed  as all the Tiramisu would be safely clinging to just one side of the container. The usual piped and chocolate dusted appearance would be a thing of memory from the good old days and there was simply no fair way of dividing the resulting partially homogenised structure into agreeably sized portions. Needless to say these Tiramisu never made it to Wednesday night.  Quarrels ensued. Who would have the thicker clumps of mascarpone topping? Who would enjoy more of the coffee liqueur soaked sponge? Our Tiramisu desert nights felt like a game of Russian roulette. My then heavily pregnant wife was showing signs that the extra stress was having an adverse effect. In an effort  I believe  to avoid more Monday night Tiramisu misery  she went into labour.   Now everyone likes order and routine. In a house with young children it is a vital ingredient in maintaining sanity. We had already missed one week s click and collect with the prize of inside out Tiramisu. This could continue no longer. We took collective action and submitted an order for delivery. Our expectations were high. Not only were we craving Tiramisu but we also had a small delivery window to hit between midwife appointments and meetings. It all went without a hitch. Shopping safely delivered and tidied away.  Dinners and bedtimes achieved on schedule  I crept silently to the fridge to dispense tonight s Tiramisu. I don t know what was worse. The shock of what I found or the utter disappointment that followed. On unwrapping the Tiramisu  before opening it  I experienced a faint smell of its sugary goodness. Now I ve heard of these phenomena before  rather like the mirage in the desert  my anticipation and yearning was so great my senses were becoming muddled. Heaven knows I m so tired I might have been dreaming.  To be sure I photographed the scene (attached). What I found was an almost perfectly piped top layer. So much better than our usual click and collect Tiramisu. This one had clearly come in by plane. No white van for this Tiramisu  no sir.  But  to my horror  two of the corners were split  one having a whole chunk removed. The sent my pulse racing and my head into a spin. Was it safe to eat? How did this happen? Was it something trying to get in? Or something trying to get out? And where was the missing piece of plastic. I felt this was an important clue to determining its edibility so I set to tracing its whereabouts.  It is in this last regard I write to you  dear Tesco. My search  short as it was  and in between feeds  has borne no fruit. I have failed to locate the missing part(s) of the container. There will be no Tiramisu tonight. So I am asking with the utmost urgency whether you can mount a search of the store and the delivery van for my Tiramisu  so I may determine whether it is safe to consume  albeit now a day late (or 8 days late). I know the store is 24 hours so if there is any chance of finding it before morning I shall be up every two hours anyway and will be most grateful.   I look forward to your reply.

As you can imagine it wasn t easy but I will like to say thank you to the lovely staff that you have. I was struggling to find a cashier that wasn t full until a lady (sorry don t know the name) told me to go with her so I could pay my shopping. She was AMAZING with us and very patient. By the end she request someone from the staff to help me with my trolley to the car as I have a pushchair. I had two lovely gentleman s helping me and my girls. It was amazing how some people go beyond their responsibilities and help a customer. THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH FOR YOUR AMAZING STAFF 💖💖💖💖🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟					2016-09-26T21:48:39+0000	1474926519	2016-09-26 23:48:39	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I mainly buy tescos 4+ nappies as I find them the best.  Today while on the school run I popped into the tescos petrol station (Andover road  Winchester) and grabbed a pack as we were almost out.  When I went to change my lb  I opened the pack and was disgusted to see what looked like squashed BUGS all over them and dirty!! I don t expect to see this when I purchase baby items it s totally unacceptable.  I was forced to put a 5+ nappy on him which belonged to my 2yr old (which was too big for him) in order to then take my 4 children to the shops to get more nappies.  Im very disappointed and have been put off buying these nappies again.

The driver arrived and explained that I had 2 substitutes one was yogurts which was fine  the other was surf washing liquid but Instead of offering another fragrance they just didn t substitute!!! This was the only item I was desperately wanting as I had ran out completely. The driver  Lewis was so lovely and offered to nip to the local corner shop to get me some as my 3year old was in bed but I said no it s fine will phone customer services(10 minutes on hold no answer!!) whilst waiting on the phone my door bell went and Lewis had returned with a bottle of surf!! Lewis saved the day and I hope he will see this message so he knows what a fab guy he is. Thanks so much Lewis  hopefully I can pay it forward with one of my customers tomorrow. As for the grocery picker and customer services  it s a huge let down!!					2016-09-26T19:43:08+0000	1474918988	2016-09-26 21:43:08	753	68	794	34	896	63	52	11	155	0	745	32	7	0	1	0	0

Unfortunately they are meaningless. Obviously I m not expecting a great amount of  nutrition  and the taste is really all that matters  however I am a bit stuck. The label specifies information for a  typical 100g . The pack has 18 mini doughnuts but no total pack weight or individual doughnut weight. This means unless I go find some weighing scales and a calculator  I am unable to relate any of the information to anything really. Please help me out.

Glanced at the ingredients when I was about to open them  they contain cream and casein... So two lots of dairy on an item labeled vegan.... Not good as that could make someone ill since vegan food is dairy free. Not tesco s fault as it s a branded product  but I m mentioning it here because of the dangerous labeling.					2016-09-26T18:53:45+0000	1474916025	2016-09-26 20:53:45	0	4	0	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I called your customer services team who confirmed it had been delivered by yodel  agreed that a high value item should NEVER be left on anyone s front doorstep  and that they would contact yodel and get back to me immediately. well I m still waiting  in fact I ve called customer services again twice since... and have been  accidentally  hung up on twice by one of you  customer service managers .   I wasn t annoyed with Tesco at first. I just put it down to another shocking experience from the joke that it YODEL (they once ripped a family friends electric gate straight off the wall and then drove away... ..) but I did expect TESCO to sort it out.  Please get back to me as soon as possible. At the very least I would like to actually receive the item I paid for.   please get back to me. quite frankly I m tired and fed up and want this resolved this evening.					2016-09-26T18:01:46+0000	1474912906	2016-09-26 20:01:46	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Only to be told that I wouldn t be guarantied to get the same next day delivery that I d chosen originally  but it  might be there for 4pm tomorrow   which means another opportunity to sit in traffic for an hour.

First off I arrive and realise I don t have any change for a trolley  unlike ANY OTHER supermarket in MK here I have to use the archaic system of a pound coin to retrieve a trolley  so a trip to the ATM and then customer services and I can finally start my shop. But wait! Said pound coin falls straight out of the knackered old trolley as soon as it released!  Now I can start my shop I make way to the fresh produce aisles  to find literally every other item totally empty  resulting in me settling for items I didn t want or leaving items altogether.  Once finished I make my way to the tills and they are closing faster than people are walking up.  I d would expect these conditions at 8 in the evening but at 5:30 when customers are coming in post work  I expect better!  Disappointed.					2016-09-26T17:17:26+0000	1474910246	2016-09-26 19:17:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He needed a few grocery items and I asked him to look for some knee high socks for our daughter for school which she asked for. After wondering around the clothing section after doing a grocery shop (he was aware of the time and was closing soon) he asked a member of staff for help. She did help him showing him the different socks you sold but then as it hit 4pm the lights went out and she said sorry cant help you now its 4pm and she walked off! He came home with no socks cue upset daughter! Now I understand the closing time of 4pm I also work in a supermarket but never ever would I just walk off at 4pm from a customer needing help   its unprofessional and not to mention just plain rude! I would seriously have a talk to staff regarding customer service!!					2016-09-26T16:29:02+0000	1474907342	2016-09-26 18:29:02	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Apparently no record of my refund request and they can t issue it as they have to chase the money up first as it s a third party item! Are you kidding me! Surely they have funds for that!

Contactless payment didnt work so had to do chip and pin. Went to bank today to discover that tesco have put through 2 transactions of £24.10 at exactly the same time. As you put a hold on the money until bank has fully processed it I have been 24.10 short. Went into store today  NO apology given and was told  Oh it happens sometimes but if you give it few more days they might credit it back . Would Tesco be so flippant with that attitude if I had taken something and said I might pay for it in a few days????

When i asked a staff member why this was they said they may have been discontinued. I buy this salad every day during the week along with many of my colleagues so why would something that generates sales be discontinued? I had to opt for the simple salad which isnt as filling and was bulked out with the lettuce stalk which is inedible. Needless to say i am left very hungry this afternoon. Can we pretty please look at getting these back on the shelves again!					2016-09-26T13:07:35+0000	1474895255	2016-09-26 15:07:35	3	8	3	0	11	8	4	4	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Do you think Tesco could employ someone who looks over the age of 12 and who can actually tell his pollock from a sprat  on the fish counter in the Helston store? His whole  I ve left my glasses at home so I can t see anything!  line is wearing a bit thin after the 4th or 5th time  especially when he actually means  Can you point out which one is a sardine please because they all look the same to me. In fact I don t even like fish  the wee slippery sods!  I wanted to ask him to fillet a rainbow trout for me yesterday  but I was scared he d start crying. So I asked him for 2 salmon fillets instead  but unfortunately he d left his glasses at home again  so he picked up some skate wings. By the way  whilst I m here  I m looking for a job and I m passionate about fish. Pick me!! Pick me!! (I do actually wear glasses  but I rarely take them off....)

I decided to use the trolley with the car attached and with his free apple we managed to do our shop hassle free until... We tried to get back to the car 😢 there was no parent and child spaces available when parking so we had to park a few rows over which is fine however due to the terrain of the car park it was impossible to get the car trolley fully loaded with toddler and shopping back to be car safely!   One of your kind members of staff named Darren who works in the car park with the trolleys left what he was doing and asked if I needed help back to my car! I gladly accepted and between us we carried toddler and shopping bags back to car!   I want to thank Darren for going out of his way to help me  however I think we will be sticking to Tesco online delivery from now on!  Thank again from a stressed out mum and hungry toddler!

Why? I was told to make room for Christmas stuff. It s September  for heaven s sake  and that does not mean you give up on a popular Scottish brand. You still stock that Haagen Dazs stuff.

I knew I was doomed when all the pork joints were of Danish origin but I had to make a choice and grabbed the shoulder joint. On reading the packaging when I returned home I discovered it was already salted and coated in palm oil for creating the perfect crackling🙄. Fast forward to sitting down to eat it. We couldn t. The salt flavour was so strong it made my 2yo sick and my husband who usually never complains refused to eat it. He wouldn t even give it to the dog due to how salty it was.  I guess the lesson learnt is a joint that costs £4 is never going to be the best. I would be taking it all back but the packaging is in the bin and the thought of rooting through it is nearly as off putting as the pork itself.					2016-09-26T11:20:56+0000	1474888856	2016-09-26 13:20:56	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On the plus side my photo frames are in mint condition and I now have enough cardboard to build an awesome fort!  #mondaygoals	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14470529_658542264320695_9194794060993438615_n.jpg?oh=837374eeea7aefde666b3ba50c2d67fc&oe=58DEDB7C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14470529_658542264320695_9194794060993438615_n.jpg?oh=11bc2b9b338923a70e745790eefae97b&oe=58F00283	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=658542264320695&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-26T09:37:02+0000	1474882622	2016-09-26 11:37:02	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The good Quality food that goes in the bin is ridiculous  I was in your  fratton way branch portsmouth this morning at 9:30am your reduced section was filling up  your staff were behind as usual pricing it up so I asked as saw 6 packs of sealed fish pie mix 9hrs past use by date which we all know is un realistic as most food can add 3-10 days on to it.  I would of cooked it all today but no Tesco s would rather bin it  please don t give me  but If you get sick its on us  rubbish it s on me I know what I am eating.  There was nothing wrong with the fish Tesco s your just plain waste full. If your staff had done the job correctly and checked the shelves in their Isle yesterday they would ve seen the date on it and just maybe you wouldn t be wasting it today.   What I loved most was the attempt from your staff to make me believe it s not going to be wasted.  So basically those fish died for nothing your clearly impacting the environment and have no respect for it.  Tesco s it s time to change!					2016-09-26T09:15:55+0000	1474881355	2016-09-26 11:15:55	0	8	1	0	9	8	7	1	7	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

I asked for a refund and you said that would be fine and that it would take 5 days. It has now been 10 days and I have still not been issued with a refund!    I am extremely  angry and frustrated with the whole process. This is unacceptable. I would call customer services but I couldn t  find the number.   Honestly  I feel really let down by this whole situation and I am considering doing my shopping with someone else. Please rectify this as soon as possible. Maybe you shouldn t  take people s money until you deliver the merchandise.					2016-09-26T07:52:13+0000	1474876333	2016-09-26 09:52:13	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This photo was taken yesterday after I had ended up with plastic tangled round my foot nearly doing the splits as you don t tend to notice clear plastic on the floor when your looking at what your trying to find on the shelves !!  There was rubbish and packaging all up the aisle and tins of dog food stacked in such a way that had an elderly person have nudged them that pack of dog food tins would have fallen on to their leg and possibly done more significant injury to my  near splits  experience !!!  Due to having broken my legs some years back  my knee s are not great and this morning I have a knee that is like a football and very sore.    So please thank your useless staff for their lack of health and safety awareness.  Perhaps some re-training is in order  starting with the management as there was plenty of them wandering round doing nothing other than chatting  !!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q82/s130x130/14432965_10154580647433887_5250840092358976877_n.jpg?oh=201db556b8b542eab7f85ce9c40da35f&oe=58E45EC3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q86/s720x720/14432965_10154580647433887_5250840092358976877_n.jpg?oh=79981cfa46841c76afbf94d4e17507dc&oe=58ECED1E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154580647433887&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-26T07:45:59+0000	1474875959	2016-09-26 09:45:59	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ordered and paid for online grocery to be delivered on 20/9 to be delivered 12 - 2pm. My partner received missed calls at 1.23pm when he was taking a shower and called back the same numbers (no one answered!) This is still within our delivery time.   We received email from Tesco saying failure delivery to due to no one at home and replied back on the same day asking on how our orders would be delivered again BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY? It s already nearly a week. Is someone going to follow up on our paid order???  Can someone follow up on our order please?!  Order number:13225-10801  I think Tesco should improve their services by also checking at our doors to see if anyone is at home. Not just merely making calls. What happens if we are in the bathroom and unable to hear the calls? We booked a time slot for a reason  and that would mean we will be at home during that period. OR maybe a suggestion  pre-emp us a call before coming?! if you re really worried we would be  out  ?					2016-09-26T06:19:08+0000	1474870748	2016-09-26 08:19:08	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had arranged for my shopping to be delivered between 7-11pm tonight. My husband received a text to say they would deliver between 9 and 10pm. At 9.41 a missed call from the driver as they were unable to find the property (even though I had written very clear instructions on the order on how to find the property and other drivers had never had a problem)! At 9.44 we call the number back. No answer. When we phone tesco at 10.01 we are told the driver attempted to deliver and had to take our delivery back to the store. So in the space of 3 mins after calling us the driver had returned to the store. I find this very hard to believe! Reality is we were blatantly the drivers last delivery. They couldn t be bothered to find the property and when we didn t answer the call thought  I ve attempted to deliver so end of my shift!   Absolutely ridiculous. The worst part of it all the fact that my twin babies now do not have the milk they need.

This is something I truly feel passionate about and cannot believe in this day and age people are still so ignorant abut special needs. Earlier I was in Tescos. I see an adult with Austim whom I know well. I hear the Tesco workers moaning that he is always in here and does not listen to them and is always asking questions. To which they were complaining about whatever he was picking up. He took too many toilet rolls which if I am correct he is paying for and can take as many as he wants. As I queue I hear a member of staff ask another member of staff to come and see him and what this  troublemaker  is doing. I inform the lady on the till that I know him and he has special needs she had never heard of  Austim  and could I tell another member of staff to which I did   tut  tut  and he turned his back on me. I am utterly shocked and disgusted that this is happening  I could not believe no one would understand what I was saying and even worse than that I had members of staff turn their backs on me. Extremely shocked at Tesco and their workers. 😡  I hope the staff are disciplined and trained  if they can t be respectful make them work away from customers.

You really should sort this out and soon as I m sure I m not the only customer tonight absolutely furious with the level of crappy service we have received from ur SEACROFT store in leeds!!					2016-09-25T21:23:12+0000	1474838592	2016-09-25 23:23:12	0	9	1	0	10	8	4	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

However there was an unexpected visitor that arrived with this celery-a worm. Now I usually don t mind  I love guests! But unfortunately I recently moved into student accommodation and there is a strict rule on no pets and visitors have to be kept to a minimum. It s great to see this celery is very popular amongst many and that it s not got anything artificial in it.

Also to take the chance to give you some positive feedback amongst all the negative ones. As there was no one in the queue behind us your employee Emily was extremely patient with the little ones  not only letting them scan their own goods  but letting the girls take it in turns of two items each and they kept swapping through the 30 odd items that we purchased.

Yet again you ask one person one day something  and another member of customer services tells you the complete opposite. Then when you ask to speak to a manager  they will not come  I am referring to Mr John McIntrye (manager in charge this afternoon) who had a conversation with Johnathon  (customer services this afternoon) but not me. Why are these staff not given the same training? If they don t know the answer  why don t they just say  sorry I am not sure of the answer to your query? In my personal experience there have been at least 6 incidents  from returning clothes  to ordering on line stuff and having it delivered in store  to points on cards  and goods avaiable  that the staff in here have given wrong information.

This thick gloppy yellow puss! This is not acceptable to sell to customers and infected chicken... what else is not acceptable is that you have been doing business with a company that has chickens and to have mistreated this chicken horribly to have this sort of cyst on its body... what made me feel terrible that this chicken was killed for no purpose because I shall not be cooking this chicken  or eating it... so this chicken was mistreated and kept in a terrible home... not happy!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14494843_1693627064297710_1485441096502582666_n.jpg?oh=b880553c40186fe12b4c07a4770b3096&oe=58DDD7C0	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14494843_1693627064297710_1485441096502582666_n.jpg?oh=665e94c5b299aa943327b1c4a5982d68&oe=58DE93D5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1693627064297710&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-25T19:47:36+0000	1474832856	2016-09-25 21:47:36	0	7	0	0	7	6	3	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I phoned customer services who  after phoning the store  told me that my delivery driver had driven all his hours today so I wouldnt be getting my shopping.  When was I going to be told?  If I didn t  have delivery saver I d take my custom elsewhere   then again maybe that s why I didnt get my delivery  after all I ve already paid for my delivery upfront  I m stuck with Tesco now.					2016-09-25T19:20:33+0000	1474831233	2016-09-25 21:20:33	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

To walk out of the store and to eat one  to find out that it was the soggiest rotting thing I ve ever bought. So I returned to the store and looked at the other donuts to realise that ONLY TESCO S donuts did NOT have sell by dates  where as all the rest did. So after waiting for a good 30 minutes after bieng told the manager would be out in a minuite. Turns out the member of staff forgot  to which she offered a refund  witch I declined  and when I then asked her why TESCO S brand didn t have sell by dated on  she grinned/smirked. And replied with  I don t know  at that point I asked that you had your store donuts either removed or checked. I didn t accept a refund as 70p wasn t a miss  but what I don t agree with you to be selling rotten food and you making on it.   Furthermore I would like an answer to the sell by date situation.  Many thanks  Jess					2016-09-25T19:16:04+0000	1474830964	2016-09-25 21:16:04	2	10	2	1	13	10	3	7	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

However  when I got to the electrical desk I was told the product had been discontinued.

I immediately picked it up and put it in my trolly until I found a colleague to say it should not be reduced. The lady i took it too obviously knew it shouldn t have been there and said thank you  however I feel you need to pay more attention to staff training so this does not happen again. It is  or at least should be known that you cannot reduce or promote infant 1st milks. Somehow this has ended up on the reduced shelf so I think you need to advise all staff on this problem with this.					2016-09-25T15:51:26+0000	1474818686	2016-09-25 17:51:26	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One of these places was Tesco Petrol Station in Bidston  Wirral. I used a pump that is left open overnight  when staff have locked up the shop. I m concerned that the security at the petrol station may not be up to scratch; I believe that there is a high chance that this is where my card details were stolen. Having reviewed the news about card skimming  it seems that this is happening a lot at Tesco petrol stations. I want to know what Tesco is doing to check its pay at pump card machines.					2016-09-25T15:47:16+0000	1474818436	2016-09-25 17:47:16	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As the queues down parking aisles merge onto the main exit road  the  delight  that was the car park attendant gave precedence to the first parking aisle  whilst signal to the main exit road queue to wait. There were a further 3 parking aisles full of queued cars waiting to merge onto the main exit road  meaning that if you were in one of these queues (like I was) your wait was far longer than that of the first aisle. I watched that first aisle empty 3 times while stationary waiting to exit! When I was finally on the main exit road  I was signaled to wait again by this attendant  so I questioned him and advised that I d been waiting at this point for an hour and half and that his  help  was causing prolonged waiting times for the queues down the aisles further back in the car park. I was then told to  Go home and just be happy I m doing my job!    Totally unacceptable!

I went with Sam and he climbed in the trolley. No room for shopping like  but who cares as he is happy. Walked in the store and  Dear me  The noise was winding me up. I could see Sam was getting agitated  but I went with it hoping he would calm. A few items were bought before I noticed Sam changing. I stopped the trolley and tried to calm him but it was too late. The meltdown had started.The Colli-flower went flying through the air and I just managed to save the breadstick. Then  the high pitched scream came. That earth shattering scream that breaks your heart. Breaks my heart  but not the silly cow nosing at the cheese in the aisle. Oh no!! She felt the need to face us and shout very load  for f*cks sake . I asked her if the scream had effected her ears and her reply was  Yes actually  it did . Then it was my turn  Good!! Now you may have a small understanding what this guy is going through. He hears everything 20  30 40 times more than me and you. He is hearing all kinds in here and it has caused this meltdown. Not that an idiot like you is going to understand or care about an upset child as you are to interested in your selfish ears.       With that I heard clapping. Turning around I saw a man and women applauding and saying  Well said lad . The woman trotted of head down and ashamed. The couple offered to walk around and help me get my shopping. also said they would pack everything at the till for me. I refused their offer but thanked them for it. At the till Sam was still upset and a few tuts were given his way. These were solved by me glaring at those doing it. I will not just take Sam out of the store  I cuddle him and help him through it. Then we loaded the shopping and the lady on the till began her magic. She told the customers  This will take as long as this little boy needs  so I suggest you move to another till if you are in a hurry . Then she refused to allow me to pack a bag  and let Sam play with the card machine that he was interested in. She was wonderful and helped calm Sam down by allowing him all the time he needed. Her name was Toni  and I gave feedback about her great service to her manager...... Shopping is never boring with our kids.  Big well done to Toni  #AutismAwareness #DifferentNotLess					2016-09-25T15:14:38+0000	1474816478	2016-09-25 17:14:38	7	1	7	0	8	1	1	0	1	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

Used the scan as you shop. So I ve got a big shop and she had to scan 33 items. Picking the beer up and then puts it down on top of yogurts. So please tell me what is the point in shop and scan if u can t pack your shopping nicely going along? She routed all the way down to the bottom of my bags and i understand its to make sure that i have not stolen anything but still after i have packed it all so as not to put heavy things on things like eggs and yogurts etc i think its bad that this happend.  Is there anyway this can be resolved?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14440697_1272876479432010_5509148969580343674_n.jpg?oh=a81b6496d2049970cb132c2a96115bca&oe=58D62AB5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14440697_1272876479432010_5509148969580343674_n.jpg?oh=59cee9b17c38664852294ba8d49b13e0&oe=58ED0FA0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1272876479432010&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-25T15:00:56+0000	1474815656	2016-09-25 17:00:56	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A problem with the sizing apparently  only  this is now the second time a faulty item has arrived. I have a child who is 94cm tall  size 3-4 is supposed to be up to 104cm. Tesco solution this time around...order a bigger size!! Only  that ll probably be sized correctly and be dress-like. Still waiting for correct measurements of this item to be sent...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-0/s130x130/14494839_10153821503701722_3170618540897753757_n.jpg?oh=5f78e2e87668f92ae4e09e7a2daeb03c&oe=58E6B513	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/l/t1.0-9/s720x720/14494839_10153821503701722_3170618540897753757_n.jpg?oh=2715058606e41f4764c6443f0f22062a&oe=5918911E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153821503701722&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-25T14:48:33+0000	1474814913	2016-09-25 16:48:33	0	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	5	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately this wood is not fit for purpose and you should not be selling it. It has obviously been left out in the rain outside the store or got wet in transit as all it did was produce vast quantities of smoke. When we chopped the wood in half it was soaking wet inside. It clearly has not been seasoned before sale. We are extremely disappointed that these are being sold and it ruined our campfire! We would like compensation for the cost of this product which was around £14 for 2 bags. Look forward to your response.

My little boy whose just turned 4 and has aspergers absolutely adores her -he doesn t take well to new people or places but over the past few months he looked forward to every visit in case she was in. Unfortunately  we moved to Wales this week and he never got chance to say goodbye to her :( he s not forgiven me yet for it. She has always been friendly polite and welcoming and is a total credit to the store. Even went hunting for kinder eggs when there wasn t any on the shelf for him as he was on total meltdown that there wasn t any. So if it s possible please sends Deegens goodbyes and our thanks for everything our tesco journeys juat aren t the same now					2016-09-25T13:39:29+0000	1474810769	2016-09-25 15:39:29	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t what annoys me more - that I ve been short changed  or that someone out there is enjoying 7 delightful puddings for Sunday dinner! Fortunately  as my husband is in a generous mood after winning his football match this morning  he was kind enough to let me have 3 and he had 2. Had he lost his match  however  I m sure our Sunday lunch would have been ruined by your dreadful counting at the packing factory.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14469461_10154043780939423_1541326442360198190_n.jpg?oh=1440c1f52c58738ddc613fbcd1a6e258&oe=58DFAF44	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14469461_10154043780939423_1541326442360198190_n.jpg?oh=8bedebe95f237a0d541d7bdb3b936ebc&oe=58E1EF49	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154043780939423&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-25T13:04:40+0000	1474808680	2016-09-25 15:04:40	11	13	16	0	29	13	3	10	6	0	11	0	0	5	0	0	0

I wasnt happy about this and asked for a refund  the member of staff walked away  and another member of staff came up and asked us what was wrong  we told them we had been given cold food  they shook there head at us  and then said do you still want the toast  we replied no  after a few minutes we were given our money back  no explanation as to why our order was served cold  or why it would take so long to cook replacements  we did get a  Sorry about that  as we were leaving. Well Sorry to say tescos we will not be visting your Cafe again  poor customer service and even worse food !					2016-09-25T12:59:47+0000	1474808387	2016-09-25 14:59:47	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I picked up a click and collect shopping order on Thursday from your bursledon towers branch and the person who packed my bags left the lid of the  mould and Mildew remover  bottle un done... Not only did this they fail to notice  they also didn t double bag it and they put it in with the dishwasher tablets... I m no chemist but a car with three children  a hot day  two chemicals containing bleach could of made a toxic situation... Luckily I only live 10 mins away... I think my boot has survived but my cardigan has not!!!!! Please could someone call back as promised on Thursday to resolve this!!! Also the £5 you promised me yesterday for me having to phone again hasn t been credited to my account...

The lady was very off and although there was nobody in the department we were told a 40 minute wait before she would take the photos as she was behind with her work and wanted to go home at 4pm. Well tesco it s the last time you will see us spending money at your stores!!!!!!

She has not had a real birthday party in 4 years as we had not been able to afford one. This year we mananaged to throw one for her and wanted it to be a good one seeing as she had waited so long to celebrate properly with her friends. Instead of candles we decided to do something a bit special and bought one of your mini number sparklers for her cake to give her and her friends something a bit special. However sadly no sooner had the sparkler been lit the whole thing went out so she never got to see it  and as we had no candles she had a very bare cake 😢. Looking forward to hearing back from you.

We park our car in the car park near the entrance to Tesco.  My sister open her car booth for me to put the groceries in n was looking for her keys to open the door when she notice a proton satria light metallic brown coming to a stop near us. A young Malay boy got out of the car and came straight to my sister to snatch her handbag. She was screaming n I took the trolley next to me to push at the guy. His friend drove the car next to us n open the door for him. He drag my sister on the floor until the bag came off. They took off n we look around for the security officer for help. When the guy came in white uniform he just listen n call another Indian guy who told us to check out the cctv camera which was just a few feet away from us. My sister went to the office but could not view it. They told my sister that they just saw us pushing the trolley n opening the car booth to put things in but can t see the proton car n the snatch thieve incident 😬 The people in Tesco was of no help non did they take any responsibility for the incident that happen inside the car park. We have to run around to go to the security office n then customer service counter to write a report. No assistance was given to us. It seem like a daily incident n nobody was interested in what happen to us. Lucky for us my sister was not hurt but the incident was quite traumatic to have your bag snatch in broad daylight.  I hope Tesco Ara damansara will take responsibility to beef up security in their car park n be more people friendly when incidents like that happens to their customers.  They did not render any help to us except to listen and walk away.  We will not be going to Tesco to do our shopping any more.

It means that I can find a parking space after 10am on Sunday now rather than getting there by 9.30am.

I checked the packet and  lo and behold   Improved  is stamped on it. Whatever you ve done to them now gives my son a sore rash and makes him leak every time. We ve switched to different nappies in the same size and had no issues whatsoever  but now I ve got a bunch of pull up nappies that I ve just wasted my money on because you ve messed around with them for no reason at all.					2016-09-25T08:24:40+0000	1474791880	2016-09-25 10:24:40	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I came down the stairs  and opened the packet of biscuits  took a couple out. i have to hide them from my 19month old as she not allowed them  so 2 are hidden quite well i can eat them discreetly and avoid her saying  bic bic mine .... I come to sit down and eat them  i put just a tiny bit of biscuit in my mouth and realised it was soggy!!  It couldnt of been my 19month old or 4yr old that some how got a sneaky dribbly nibble of the biscuit as im very much used to! ... i even thought maybe the dog had a cheeky lick as i walked from kitchen to living room as shes quite known for pinching a biscuit or two... wasnt her either she was snoring in her bed! So i checked the packet and it seems as though actually half the packet of biscuits is infact wet 😭   A bourbon biscuit will have to do instead.					2016-09-25T07:29:49+0000	1474788589	2016-09-25 09:29:49	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got ponchos at the ready (bound to rain) and made a picnic from scratch (healthier than the stalls). We then went to mix the gin (which was bought at the Skegness store about three weeks ago) and tonic to bottle up as it is a sure fire way to warm up the cockles at an out door cinema (and easier if premixed if it s cold) and the gin is RED?! It is Gordon s 1litre gin and in all my times of drinking Gordon s special dry gin I have not known it to be red. It is thick almost like a syrup. I could only put it on par with a port that came out. I tried a small amount and it is like a thick sweet wine. I daren t try anymore as I don t actually know what it is. Suffice to say we now have a lovely picnic accompanied by slim line tonic.

You see I am pregnant and Smidge is the nickname for the baby.  My problem is this....  Up until recently I had been really enjoying eating tins of Royal Dansk Butter and Chocolate Chip Cookies.  You were selling these at both your Aylesbury stores  but alas you never have them in stock anymore.  We all know it s hard enough being pregnant  what with morning sickness  being tired all the time  not to mention the countless trips to the loo.  But now to add to all that I have lost the one thing I have cravings for  do you see why i am so heartbroken.  What makes it worst is that my other half was prepared to spend £10 treating me to three tins for my birthday next week  although I think it s more to keep me quiet on a night time.  Please please get these back in stock at your Aylesbury stores as quickly as possible  me and Smidge really need these cookies.  Here is what the cookies look like:	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14390948_291896224536561_7863273397972077282_n.jpg?oh=bb129e61073d1135b47fc8c70d97e56f&oe=591F099C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14390948_291896224536561_7863273397972077282_n.jpg?oh=ae4091891fa13fc9a4961afee88950b9&oe=58DC1812	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=291896224536561&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-25T03:48:19+0000	1474775299	2016-09-25 05:48:19	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a pram for my baby for collection at the above store.  The email made it clear that collection was between 7am and 10pm.  I arrived at the store at 9:40pm (well within the 10pm specified in the email) and was refused by the store manager (so he claimed to be) as it was  too late .  I challenged him  and to my disbelief he admitted he did not want to go to the trouble of getting my order as he wanted to go home on time.  Does it really take 20mins to get a collection  instead he chose to be difficult for the next 20mins (surely he could have got my order in that time)?!  This is totally disgraceful  even when I explained that my baby needed a pram the following day.  I am speechless.  Tesco  is this really acceptable?					2016-09-24T21:50:58+0000	1474753858	2016-09-24 23:50:58	7	7	19	9	35	7	5	2	8	0	7	0	0	0	0	12	0

I have ended up with only three boxes of chocolates - rather than the eight I requested   - as the replacements were not given at the BOGOF price I ordered at and only half the baby milk I need.  And I am out of pocket at the three rather than four chocs as I don t get the BOGOF deal on those! My brain is officially too tired for it.  Your picker decided to get a different type of milk - which was aimed at a different age group of baby :-( To top it off the driver was late for the slot by half hour - and this was a later slot.  As a mum to a young baby I was waiting for the slot when I could have been sleeping! It sounds mad but for those moments missed  and the missed items  and I am now shattered  cranky and without what I need.  Really  really disappointed.					2016-09-24T21:34:33+0000	1474752873	2016-09-24 23:34:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Due to working late  I only opened it this morning and set it up.  The blue light on the front top doesn t light up and the light besides it seems to flicker wrong.  Also the sound when I plug speakers into it is scratchy and keeps breaking up.  The speakers have been tested on another PC and I know the lights are wrong as my mum bought this exact same PC a few months ago  which is why I got the same one  since she is very pleased with hers.  Was it a refurbished one? Could you arrange a replacement and pick up of this one  asap  as I need a PC.  Thanks.	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCIyVV34tV6hzmL&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirectuiassets%2FMerchandising%2FNonSeasonal%2Fen_GB%2Fbanners%2Fresponsive%2Ftechnology_gaming%2Ftechsupport_586x200.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQAfVPmh67avtwUO	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAy_-T4RgGNs-u3&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tesco.com%2Fdirectuiassets%2FMerchandising%2FNonSeasonal%2Fen_GB%2Fbanners%2Fresponsive%2Ftechnology_gaming%2Ftechsupport_586x200.jpg&_nc_hash=AQANuwvCQ6Lqqobj	http://www.tesco.com/direct/cube-corporal-gaming-pc-amd-a10-7700k-quad-core-with-radeon-r7-graphics-16gb-memory-desktop-amd-a-series-quad-core-seagate-1tb-7200rpm-hard-drive-wi/418-4863.prd?pageLevel=sku&skuId=418-4863	tesco.com	2016-09-24T19:59:27+0000	1474747167	2016-09-24 21:59:27	1	6	1	0	7	6	1	5	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have called the customer care helpline and got passed from person to person. Finally someone managed to get me to the right department. I told them what the problem was and they said that they will send a bag out to me so I can return my (new) phone back to you. I m not happy with this as I am going to be ANOTHER week without a phone. I pay a contract of over £20 a month which this month I will of only had my phone for half of that! I was told I will receive a class A phone once I have returned mine back to you (I was told this is a phone someone else has returned) and according to the person I spoke to on the phone I cannot return to the store I got my phone from originally... I was offered 1000 clubcard points OR my line rental paid for 1 month. but this doesn t come close to the inconvenience this has cause for me. I will still be paying for my contract even tho I wont have used it for 2 weeks!					2016-09-24T19:34:00+0000	1474745640	2016-09-24 21:34:00	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have got to say you are in my very very bad books this evening. So today I went to your Middleton store to buy the ingredients for a lovely paella. Browsing your fish mongers you had a great selection of fresh fish. I decided on fresh cod loin  Raw king prawns and fresh live mussels. So I embarked on cooking up a storm at home for our family Spanish night. The dish was in full swing  almost complete. I opened the prawns and put them in. I opened the mussels and a smell worse than death erupted in my nostrils. The mussels were not live mussels at all they were very very dead and it appeared by the smell that they had been for some time. After this I not only was very disappointed by the mussels the thought of eating the beautiful paella I had loving prepared was turning my stomach. As a fish lover I have got to tell you this saddens me very much. So the £30 on quality ingredients I spent in your store today has literally just gone down the toilet. Thanks tesco 😬😬😬					2016-09-24T18:43:07+0000	1474742587	2016-09-24 20:43:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was paying for my goods (at till 16) when I noticed a massive (I mean really huge!!!) spider 🕷 on my arm... I hate spiders 🕷 so could feel a panic coming on but Joseph (or so said his name tag!) knocked the spider away and saved the day! Thank god!

All confirmation emails arrived confirming the delivery set for today and email first thing this morning confirmed order dispatched and on it s way to the store.  Not arrived by 6pm and now Tesco Direct tell me they have oversold the consoles and are in the process of sending out emails to tell customers their orders are cancelled. If my order is NOT cancelled  it will apparently be Tuesday before I get it. Would have ordered from elswhere if I had been told this in the first place  but now it is too late and I ll have trouble sourcing a unit from anywhere else.  Tesco Direct tell me that the  Order Dispatched  email is just automatically generated on the day your order is due for delivery - not when the order is actully put on a van.					2016-09-24T17:41:52+0000	1474738912	2016-09-24 19:41:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After waiting 6 minutes to speak to a customer service manager the lady I spoke to phoned the store and was told that it was so busy it just got missed. I understand we are all human and mistakes are made but there was no one else there so to lie about it really annoyed me. I was then told that they couldn t deliver my order as all the vans were leaving now and I would have to go to store to collect it and as the click and collect pod closes at 6pm I would have to go to store. So after dragging 3 hungry  tired and grumpy children back to the store I was kept waiting for 20 for my order to be found. Morale of the story don t bother with click and collect unless you have time to check every item is there!					2016-09-24T17:23:40+0000	1474737820	2016-09-24 19:23:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

And instead in its place  where it is marked down for two different free from sandwiches  some pasta..which I cannot eat! This is not the first time it s happened either. Over the past few months I ve come in to grab a quick sandwich on the run to find nothing there and instead something else I can t eat in its place when it clearly states free from and there has never been any tags to say the items are not in stock.  I can see you probably don t stock very many and may run out by lunchtime but I have been in first thing in the morning  mid morning..basically all times of day and have never seen anything there but again something I can t eat. I have only ever been able to buy a free from sandwich once from your Eastbourne store and that was when they first came out.  It would also be a good idea to have some other alternatives instead of just a plain boring chicken salad(which never has enough chicken in!) maybe some free from pasta salads  rice salads or rice noodles would also be a brilliant option to quickly grab on the run and to be in the meal deal as us with health issues and intolerances etc are constantly getting ripped off for something we can t help!  Your free from section is slowly getting better so why not make your fresh sandwich/lunch selection better too?					2016-09-24T17:14:46+0000	1474737286	2016-09-24 19:14:46	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco Direct are a joke ... Purchased TV 3 months ago & 3 weeks ago it just turned itself off & wouldn t turn back on ... Phoned Tesco Direct & they said it was a common problem & they had several calls with the same issue.  They said they would collect it on the Monday so took the TV to Pauls mums house for them to collect from there as we are out at work all day ...  When it wasn t collected on the day they said we called them & was put through to a different company called UMC she said they don t collect the TV & instead would send a USB to fix it !!!!!!! Throughout the course of 3 weeks we have had several phone messages left saying they will pick the TV up then messages saying sorry we haven t picked your TV up ... Several emails & phone calls later Tesco Direct tell us we have to take a photo of the front of the TV with it on ... Tesco Direct the whole problem is we can t turn the TV on you morons ... & have now had an 86 year old lady waiting every day for you to do what you promised ... Collect the TV & fix it ...

My partner  23 month old son and I popped in quickly to grab some bits and bobs when suddenly my son begins to projectile vomit down one the aisles completely out of the blue. There was an assistant literally standing inches away from us during this and I had to ask twice if she could help us before she walked off without saying a word  I assume to get someone else to deal with it. After waiting in the aisle with my son still vomiting  I ran to see if anyone could help. A passing employee merely said  a cleaners coming  without even offering to help.  Thankfully a lovely customer stopped and opened a bottle of water she d just bought and gave us a material like bag to help clean up my son and partner who were both stood  covered in vomit.  Out of everyone in store today only one lady  a customer  stopped to help and none of your staff to offer any assistance. The customer service was such a disappointment.					2016-09-24T16:29:09+0000	1474734549	2016-09-24 18:29:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

While paying for my fuel I politely informed the cashier that the sign needed changing to say that assistance dogs were allowed  before he even had a chance to respond his colleague Graham rather rudely told me it didn t. I asked him what someone with an assistance dog was supposed to do to which he replied  well if someone tells us they need an assistance dog we ll tell them they can bring it in . All very well and good of course but assistance dogs are there for a variety of reasons  most people are aware of guided dogs and hearing dogs for the deaf  but there are also assistance dogs that can do seizure alert  blood sugar alert for diabetics and even dogs to help with anxiety. Now you wouldn t expect someone with a crutch or walking stick or wheelchair to ask if it was ok to use it and an assistance dog is exactly the same. This sign is currently breaching the disability discrimination act.   I tried to explain this to graham and his reply was simply  if you say so   I asked if he would be changing the sign and he told me he wasn t going to bother. His whole attitude was very rude indeed!  Tesco it would be really great if you could not only get this sign changed as I assume its one you use all over the country  but if you could also arrange some training for Grumpy Graham that would be good too. I ve visited the west durrington extra store with my assistance dog many times and the staff there have always been incredibly helpful even when she was training so Graham s attitude was a shock	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14370075_10154585330464111_3173894568208088673_n.jpg?oh=a9ac39c2d08f6ef10e2aa55fb5c60e7c&oe=58EDB73C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14370075_10154585330464111_3173894568208088673_n.jpg?oh=4f9acc8eb94ebd920abdb6ba00ba95d5&oe=59210031	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154585330464111&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-24T15:53:44+0000	1474732424	2016-09-24 17:53:44	2	8	4	1	13	7	6	1	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	2	0

All were labelled as double. Today I moved into my flat and went to unpack the bedding to find that the  double  duvet  was in fact a single. As you can see it clearly states double  but there is so much space left in the duvet cover  and it doesn t fit my bed. It s frustrating as its another thing to stress about on moving day even though it s supposed to be one of the things you look forward to!

Bought a £450 tv from Baldock only to get home and find the casing split.  Had to drive back to Baldock and exchange for another.  Just opened that one and the screen is smashed.  Now got to take that back .  So there and back 3 times and no tv because that was their last one.  What a waste of time  won t be buying anything expensive from them again.  Now have to look again tomorrow.  Rubbish.					2016-09-24T15:00:07+0000	1474729207	2016-09-24 17:00:07	0	7	0	0	7	7	1	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered a TV from Tesco Direct on Monday  paying extra for nominated delivery. it arrived with the screen shattered to pieces. Contacted customer services and that model was out of stock. Have to kick up a fuss about the delivery fee and the discount code in order for them to agree to allow me to choose an alternative up to £20 more expensive. Said they could not compensate me for sitting in all day and that the alternative TV would be delivered on Friday. CEO s office contacted me and gave me £50 compensation for the fact I wasted a day of my time etc.  Waited in all day on Friday; I did not leave my home once. I was tracking the delivery on Yodel s website  only for them to update the status to  sorry we missed you  we ve left a calling card . No calling card was left  of course because delivery had not been attempted. Yodel refused to do anything other than to say they would  try again tomorrow . I should point out that they were supposed to be collecting the faulty TV to return to you.  Contacted the CEO s office again. They arranged for the TV to be delivered last night at 8pm from a local store (thank you for that  that was appreciated)  however the driver was not instructed to collect the faulty TV. So now I need to give you access to my home for a THIRD time to collect it. However  given that Yodel said that they would be coming again today  I waited in and the tracker has now been updated to  delay - delivery in the next 72 hours .  Contacted customer services who have said they can arrange collection on a day suitable to me but it will be a window from 7am-7pm. They also want to use Yodel  the company who could not be bothered attempting to deliver on the contracted date and have now still not managed to do so and are expecting to me to wait about for another 3 days.   By now I have wasted THREE days of my time for this complete and utter shambles. There is absolutely no way that I will be wasting a fourth day of my life on this nonsense  waiting around for incompetent no show contractors. You can contact me and arrange a collection on a suitable day and provide me with a reasonable window for collection. I am employed and have things to do not involve sitting in my home like a recluse waiting for you to get your act together.  I fully expect to be compensated for the time I have spent wasted on this ridiculous situation that should have been resolved in 24 hours but almost a week later is still dragging on. My time is easily quantifiable. What sort of amateur show are you running here?  that you cannot deliver a television in an acceptable condition in three attempts?!					2016-09-24T14:07:59+0000	1474726079	2016-09-24 16:07:59	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

If u need to shop at the deli counter etc u better hope that they have the staff to man it  maybe we should all take this into consideration before we go for our shopping  better yet maybe we should call the stores and ask them how their staffing levels are before we go in  in fact what we are probably better doing is not shopping there at all!! Seriously I have never heard of anything so ridiculous!!					2016-09-24T13:45:51+0000	1474724751	2016-09-24 15:45:51	1	3	2	0	5	3	3	0	14	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

I think you may need to re train your staff  Samantha in particular who is working behind the kiosk. Funny thing is she looked as if she was a manager of some sort  therefore should know better. As she is setting a bad example to the rest of the staff working there  maybe this explains why the attitude from the majority of the staff members is disgraceful. She was rude  and didn t say a word throughout the transaction apart from the total of the bill  not asking if I had a Tesco club card. Nor a please and thank you. As a matter of fact I do have a Tesco clubcard that won t be getting used anytime soon as I will not be shopping in Tesco again. I hope you look into this matter to prevent you losing further custom in the future due to this Ill-mannered member of staff.					2016-09-24T13:05:02+0000	1474722302	2016-09-24 15:05:02	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Your manager had a very kind chat with my son and I m hoping this will teach him never to steal anything again  but as I was walking out the door he called to me and said that he at tesco would like to help me at Christmas with something for the boys. Can I just say thank you we as a family of 3 have nothing but each other and I am so grateful to him for this oppertunity I appreciate this so much and am so grateful  Thank you to you manager at diss tesco  Love  Caroline Riley and Kye x					2016-09-24T12:19:22+0000	1474719562	2016-09-24 14:19:22	3	1	4	0	5	1	1	0	0	0	3	1	0	0	0	0	0

There is an operation he can have that will allow him to walk unaided  however if he doesn t have this operation he will end up wheelchair bound.  This operation is no longer funded by the NHS due to cutbacks. So his parents need to raise the £21000 to pay for this operation. He is such a lovely little boy and he really wants to be able to run around and play with his friends. Please donate if you can  or at least share the link.

Unfortunately its developed a fault. I rang your helpline who were great and they told me to take it back to store and they would exchange it. I took it back this morning and a member of staff at your customer service desk took the details and told us to  go upstairs and see if you can find one   really helpful. We went upstairs and did find one however this one was a newer model and cost more.  Because you no longer stock the old model (and from what I can see it s not on sale anymore)  you expect me to pay the difference! Whilst it was only £15 more it s the principle  the original goods were faulty. I m disgusted at the attitude I experienced as I quote  obviously it s not our fault and obviously you can t expect Tesco to pay more when it s a Tefal model . Think I will be taking my business elsewhere in future 😡😡					2016-09-24T11:39:49+0000	1474717189	2016-09-24 13:39:49	0	4	0	0	4	4	1	3	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Twice this week I ve made an online order. First time I had an order acknowledgment etc but no order.  Last night I gave it a second chance and ordered £40.25 of groceries for click and collect to be collected between 12 and 2  order acknowledged and payment taken. My stepdad has just gone to collect it to be told there is only £8 worth of groceries as the rest is not actually there and hasn t been since yesterday morning.  I d like to know the following: Why was my order accepted and payment taken if the chosen foods were not actually in stock? Why I had no notification or contact from the online ordering service team to say the chosen items were out of stock? Why are you selling items online that are actually not available?  This is twice that my time has been completely wasted and orders accepted for items that we not available to collect. I believe there are laws against that?  I personally refuse to shop with you. Unfortunately my parents are only just learning  after £80 of online orders  that you aren t worth the hassle.  I would like my questions answered and if they aren t  I will be contacting trading standards about the sale of goods online and payments taken for items you actually don t have in stock.					2016-09-24T11:35:54+0000	1474716954	2016-09-24 13:35:54	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m 25 and had valid ID! My boyfriend however is 21 and as it wasn t his shopping nor was he carrying any of it to or near the checkout. The alcohol prompted the girl on the till to ask for ID so without a problem I presented my passport only for her to ask my boyfriend for his once i was about to pay and he walked over to help me... now unfortunately he didn t have any but as I say this wasn t his shopping and he wasn t under 18 but I assume that is irrelevant  I can understand that if it was a group of younger lads or girls next to me who I didn t know or if I didn t have ID but what if I was to try and buy this meal deal with a child of mine ? Would I be asked for ID then is that not exactly the same? You know just in case I want to get my baby drunk (I dont have a baby). I thought it was ridiculous. If he would of been putting the alcohol on the belt or clearly under 18 then I could maybe understand but when I spoke to the manager in store he insisted it was company policy clearly not the challenge 25 policy though. I was just wondering what happens if the random person behind me next time will be asked or maybe the person being served on the opposite checkout! It was just inconvenient that we had to walk to another tesco so I could buy the same deal whilst he waited outside. I m aware of the challenge 25 policy but I m pretty sure if he clearly wasn t purchasing the alcohol the cashier shouldn t be asking him for ID! I ve worked in retail and I m aware you shouldn t buy alcohol for anyone under 18 and will be asked for ID if you look under 25 and that you will not be served if you appear intoxicated however I was not aware you will not be served if there is a person under 25 within a 2meter radius who attempts to help u ?? Just embarrassing and very frustrating! I m sure your sales in alcohol would increase massively if people were actually allowed to buy it with valid ID😕					2016-09-24T11:02:52+0000	1474714972	2016-09-24 13:02:52	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Over the past couple of weeks I ve been in contact with your email team about your recycled toilet rolls being wrapped in unrecyclable plastic. They have told me it IS recyclable  which I m sure you can understand is very confusing! I have asked if the packaging will be changed to reflect this (if it s true) and ask why an eco friendly product is wrapped in plastic anyway  recyclable or not  and if there are plans to change to a better packaging to reflect the product  such as paper. I have received no response from them about this and I ve alreaddy had to chase them a couple of times. To be honest  I feel like I m now being ignored. Can someone please respond to me about this? Thanks.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14469575_10101496117123325_6692777095801404840_n.jpg?oh=a0550720dab60a1443c2b9e9bcef11aa&oe=591CBEE1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14469575_10101496117123325_6692777095801404840_n.jpg?oh=fcf9af5f5ce07a041ed6204bf967ebea&oe=58EC17EC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101496117123325&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-24T08:32:05+0000	1474705925	2016-09-24 10:32:05	2	9	5	2	16	8	6	2	10	0	2	0	0	0	0	3	0

Made a Click and Collect order the other day using a voucher code. The order was accepted  confirmed and paid for. Now the order has been cancelled due to not having the items in stock. Why on earth is your system not capable of knowing if the items are in stock or not?!? The message helpfully asked me to re-order from another store but surprise surprise my voucher code is no longer valid  meaning I miss out on the discount. Not impressed at all - next time I just won t bother!					2016-09-24T08:27:02+0000	1474705622	2016-09-24 10:27:02	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Her name was Jemma and she was working last night (23/09/16) around 18.00 on the front customer services desk.  Yesterday evening I was in Sunbury driving around with a very young hungry baby and my 3 year old son. I had been driving around and around for 45 mins and I had got completely lost trying to find a friends new flat where I was meant to be meeting my friend and husband. My mobile phone battery had died and I was struggling to find a pay phone where I could stop safely with the children. I finally saw a sign for tesco and thought they must have a pay phone so I parked the car and went in the store. I asked the security guard if there was a pay phone which he said there wasn t but this young lady heard my plea and immediately offered me the use of the store phone. I was very close to tears as I had no idea where I was  Jemma offered to use her phone to find the road I was looking for and help direct me and then even went as far as seeing if there were any spare chargers laying around that I could use for a few minutes to turn my phone on and let my husband know myself and the children were safe as we were now and hour late!  Luckily my husband answered the call from tesco and they came to rescue me and turned out I was only a few roads away!  Please pass on my thanks to Jemma I am really grateful X X					2016-09-24T08:24:06+0000	1474705446	2016-09-24 10:24:06	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Last night I sat down after a game of football with my wife to eat some home prepared steak  chips  eggs and peas. Now everyone knows that you can t have chips without salt and vinegar  and true to form I gave myself a good douse of Tesco s own brand (vinegar is just vinegar regardless of brand to me!). We ve had this bottle for a few months but to our horror (as you can see from the bottle) we saw a cloth inside the bottle. Whilst not only putting me off my dinner which was swimming in vinegar already but made me feel sick that my vinegar had been contaminated for so long without me knowing! How the hell does a cloth end up in a Vinegar bottle???????	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14433229_10209909488907528_704105495656844751_n.jpg?oh=402ba649f6b0c6583b2275be0ff5eb16&oe=58DA78B9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14433229_10209909488907528_704105495656844751_n.jpg?oh=d4498866e7f0d4d65fc1d0b7f7f1ad06&oe=58D9C0AC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209909488907528&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-24T06:38:41+0000	1474699121	2016-09-24 08:38:41	1	5	3	0	8	4	4	0	0	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0

Was there yesterday 23rd October(Fri) at 1.00pm. A malay lady there was packing buns there and around 5 pieces of bun fell from the tray and rolled on the floor. She just picked up the buns packed them. This is a very serious hygiene issue. I hope you would take action on what happened and ensure that this never happens again.					2016-09-24T01:28:07+0000	1474680487	2016-09-24 03:28:07	0	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

Bless him due to road works  diversions etc he wadls running late. He gave me a call and was very apologetic over it. I had no problems with this as it s life but did ask if he could let me know when he was outside instead of ringing the bell as my little ones were fast asleep.  He kept to his word and rang me when near. So I d like to say that he deserves a big pat on the back for great customer service.

She rang your store in Station Road  Weston-super-Mare to inform them. They filled in a  dumped trolley form   At 8pm tonight it was still there! It took years of campaigning to get these trolleys actually put into supermarkets and bearing in mind how expensive they are  you d have thought it would have been collected pretty quickly but sadly  no!!!!!!!  Luckily a lovely lady who is a Mummy to her own child with additional needs lives not too far away from the trolley and took it upon herself  after seeing my Facebook post to go and collect the trolley and walk it back to Tesco (a decent walk) herself. It has now been returned NO THANKS TO TESCO! Yet again it s our super army of special needs parents that has sorted another problem ourselves! Take a look in the comments below. This is how invaluable this trolley is to this gorgeous group of little people. Supermarket shopping is something we all have to do. Without this trolley we cannot manage what most people take for granted......	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14448886_10208817090998177_356596333303666548_n.jpg?oh=e08da36fb1dc7183ee9c1aa9522cd2a0&oe=58E41573	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14448886_10208817090998177_356596333303666548_n.jpg?oh=bb339ecd44d09dd7f15b595ea469d2ce&oe=591D6666	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208817090998177&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-23T20:14:40+0000	1474661680	2016-09-23 22:14:40	12	31	15	4	50	31	20	11	31	0	12	1	0	0	0	2	0

After a few minutes a lady came out of the cubical and washed her hands and went to use the handriers  before she did she asked me if it was ok and if the kids were ok with the noise. My son turned to her and said he didn t like the noise the lady said ok and didn t use the hand drier and left. I was so so grateful as it s one less battle to face  after she left I burst into tears because she was so nice and noone has ever asked before.   Turns out her name was chloe and she works there. Just wanted to say you employ some bloody amazing staff.   <3					2016-09-23T19:06:49+0000	1474657609	2016-09-23 21:06:49	162	11	176	11	198	11	10	1	40	0	162	14	0	0	0	0	0

Tonight we took 17 rainbows  aged 5-7years to take part in the  farm to fork  store trail  the girls were able to take part in a chocolate tasting challenge  hold fishes (and see one being cut open) and to finish it off they were allowed to go on a checkout where they were able to speak to other stuff members through a head piece. We were also asked if we wanted them to find a customer for the girls to serve  unfortunately we had ran out of time so couldn t do this! The girls absolutely loved this experience whilst also learning about different foods!

I cannot believe that a multi site   million ££££ company would allow such a under performance of a subsidiary. Having ordered a sofa from Tesco direct on 17/09/16 and paid in full for delivery and goods. I have experienced the poorest customer service to date. And that is really saying something! I waited in 12 hours !! For a sofa that didn t arrive. After 5+ phone calls they eventually admitted it was out of stock and I would be refunded. 6 days after full payment of goods MY money is still sitting in a Tesco bank account. They refuse to confirm when I will receive a refund or if they will even compensate me for my lost day of work awaiting delivery. Well Tesco I know the  small  amount of money I paid you is probably very insignificant to you but as you are so keen to tell everyone  every little helps. I hope my money is earning you some interest in your bursting accounts.					2016-09-23T18:15:37+0000	1474654537	2016-09-23 20:15:37	2	10	2	0	12	10	1	9	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

So as  I needed money I went in-store to do what I had been doing for many years  namely use my TESCO BANK instant access card to take money from my TESCO bank account. Imagine my surprise when the staff member informed me she had no idea how to do this and then the manager (or a teenager purporting to be a manager) informed me this was impossible. I would have to go the 4 miles to Stockport. branch..?   I told him that I had been doing this for years previously no problems ... ( a very helpful lady called Ann) and  asked what had changed? He said it was impossible (again  as if  I was making things up) and that the transaction would not show  up on my account.  Which was absolutely not true the.numerous times I had done this before.  So I had  to buy something (they suggested a carrier bag)  so I could ask for cash back...?1 Very unhelpful and inflexible.... Maybe the ATMs should be fixed more quickly or the staff trained to be a little bit helpful???

I done the whole  get it delivered in store and then I can go anytime after 3pm to collect . Checked tracking and it says  attempted delivery card left . They will attempt to deliver it to store again tomorrow before 3pm. WHAT? It s a huge big store open 24/7 and what no one was in??? Spent 20 mins on phone and all they can say is that they can t guarantee it won t happen again tomorrow!!!  What s the point getting it delivered to store then? Tesco direct are blaming the store. The store is blaming Tesco direct. I as a customer don t seem to figure in this.					2016-09-23T16:54:10+0000	1474649650	2016-09-23 18:54:10	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have had many issues over the years with HGV s delivering to the store  including Tesco s own liveried vehicles - this had settled down  but there are now daily deliveries by Muller to the store.  I ve complained & Rutland County Council have repeatedly complained to the store  but it appears that nothing is being done to stop this.  The driver was at the store today when the manager checked his risk assessment  which clearly states that South Street should not be used.  I ve resorted to contacting you this way as nothing else has worked.  As you say...every little helps...so Tesco  perhaps you can help the local residents as it is only a matter of time before there is an accident...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14433171_1662315474083356_4867844292995426164_n.jpg?oh=49fdaf5fe55aec97fe6bf3134b8cd0dd&oe=58DDF02C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14433171_1662315474083356_4867844292995426164_n.jpg?oh=4e5e6702a6c69625425029341dd0989f&oe=58E81039	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1662315474083356&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-23T15:21:32+0000	1474644092	2016-09-23 17:21:32	0	8	1	1	10	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I suffer with the skin manifestation of cealiac as well so all week my skin has been getting so bad and I ve felt awful never thinking for one minute it could be the porridge I was sitting eating but this morning I just turned the pot round and was horrified at what I read... not suitable for everyone with cealiac!!! How can this be advertised as gluten free when there is still a risk for cealiacs surly having this printed on the front would of made more sense!!! Sorry Tesco but you ve really let me down.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14368702_1299412670098722_961992080469030917_n.jpg?oh=6a5ce90d495598031a6ac1b18c619fa0&oe=58D5EFF7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14368702_1299412670098722_961992080469030917_n.jpg?oh=89a33d8f1a12f018ee6e949b29e00328&oe=58E90308	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1299412670098722&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-23T15:16:01+0000	1474643761	2016-09-23 17:16:01	7	4	8	0	12	4	4	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	1	0	0

I asked her where my change was and she said I had only given her £1.10  I knew what money I had in my purse and knew I had given the lady a £10 and 10p.  The lady still kept insisting I had only given her a £1 coin  so I then asked her to do a till check.  The lady dissapeared for what seemed like ages  over 15minutes and when she came back a bit red in the face said I must have been right as her till was £9 up and apologised. That IS NOT good enough do you know how embarrassing it is to near enough be called a liar when you know you are right.  There were other people walking past me aswell  I was getting quite worried as that meant I would have £9 less for my top up shopping in the week and sweat was pouring off my head.  Yes I got the money back but that is not the point it was very humiliating stood at the front of the store waiting for her to come back after doing a till check.  When I got to the car I ended up in tears and am still quite upset about the whole experience!.					2016-09-23T15:02:35+0000	1474642955	2016-09-23 17:02:35	0	7	0	0	7	7	1	6	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Got 2 reduced pork items at the same time and put both in freezer at same time. Took both out to defrost in microwave.  Defrosted one with no problem. Put other one to defrost and went upstairs.  Came back down to find flames in microwave. Very very dangerous practice. After investigating found a tiny warning label . Certainly not big enough for normal working mums to notice.  Please make all with security or all with none. It s too easy to make a mistake and end up with a house fire.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14359125_1365322973497643_3930684563826031306_n.jpg?oh=ce437043965d9f00eea6572e5924f75e&oe=58E9EA7F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14359125_1365322973497643_3930684563826031306_n.jpg?oh=cff7b77a34aaf7f084bc6c9a72167580&oe=58E3E76A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1365322973497643&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-23T13:55:23+0000	1474638923	2016-09-23 15:55:23	0	4	1	1	6	4	4	0	15	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

I had pre ordered a quantity of bread rolls to be collected this morning at 10am. When I arrived at 10.05am I was told by the assistant on bakery that he would have to package up some more rolls as the ones done and put aside had been taken by other staff. Staff putting together click & collect orders. This is not good enough. Thankfully they did have more fresh rolls ready for packaging  but what would have happened if they hadn t? I do not blame the young man who then packaged some more for me  he was apologetic and it was not his fault. But I suggest other members of staff are given training and make sure they do not help themselves to reserved products in future.					2016-09-23T12:52:16+0000	1474635136	2016-09-23 14:52:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Happy. Always smiling. Big smile. Nice white teeth. I like her voice  soft  can t quite place it. Grey blue eyes. Not too much make-up but red lipstick (I like that). She s got lightish brown hair. Quite long. Always has it up. In a bun (I think it s called). Her yeah. That s the one. I like her. She s a little bit cuddly looking. Am I allowed to say a bit plump? It s in a nice sort of way. If she s on the check out counter I always go to her till. Even if I have to wait for the queue to go down. I think she only works part time   cos some days she s not anywhere to be seen  even if I go in several times. She ain t got a wedding ring on. Not that that means much these days! Well  anyway she has noticed that I am on an organic diet because  well she mentioned it actually. She said to me - when I was shopping last Tuesday it was  - she said to me - well sort of exclaimed it really - she said   my goodness  what a lot of healthy shopping!  So I told her about me being on this organic diet and that  and how it s made me feel tons better and about me walking a lot easier and all that. And she seemed really interested. She said she might give it a go herself. But d you know what she said after that  when I was putting me shopping into me shopping bag? Funny thing is  even me shopping bags one of them organic ones! D you know what she said? No course you don t you weren t there. She said - and she had her lovely big smile on when she said it. Looked me right in the eye she did - she said   well I must say   she said   I must say  you do look really well on it  a lot better.  Well  I ll tell you what. I was made up with her saying that I can tell you. Not just because it means me organic diet must be working. No  not just  cos of that. No  but because if she thinks I look a lot better now than I did before  it must mean she has noticed me before. You know what I mean? Well  it must mustn t it? I reckon she fancies me. Grace her name is. She didn t tell me. It s on her badge. She s really nice! PS. This is just a story. I made the whole thing up. Although I wouldn t be at all surprised if women do think I look good on me new diet!					2016-09-23T12:41:26+0000	1474634486	2016-09-23 14:41:26	1	3	1	0	4	3	3	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Paying at the self service check out when my 6 week old newborn was crying due to being put back in the car seat  a member of your staff at this time walked over to me  asked  is it hungry  (seriously   it ?!)  as I replied  no   before following with  anyway you better leave before people start shouting ! 1) I won t ever be shopping at your store again  2) EVERY baby cries  and in this situation my baby became inconsolable  and I could understand if I was letting my child run the store ragged or distressing other customers  but this was a situation which could not be helped. The only person who was left stressed and embarrassed was myself as your colleague also felt the desire to point out the age gap between my two girls (as if I was obviously blissfully unaware) and how much they  look like a handful . Think some customer service training is required tesco! #tescostairfoot #tescowombwell #tesco					2016-09-23T12:12:11+0000	1474632731	2016-09-23 14:12:11	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is food destined to go straight in the fridge! They turned up only 3 minutes before the end of the hour slot i d booked. I was tight for time myself at that point so asked them to leave the bags outside the kitchen door- (easier and quicker for me to sort it all myself) not to dump all the stuff out and leave me with torn and unusable bags as well!...					2016-09-23T11:15:22+0000	1474629322	2016-09-23 13:15:22	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The hustle and bustle was fantastic and I loved the tubs of sweets you had on offer - it s beginning to look like Christmas right?   ANYWAY....   Now I am not normally one to moan but something horrific happened today and I have to make you aware of your health and safety issues regarding your french sticks.  I bought a french stick for my lunch today. Its been a long week and I was looking for something to reduce my hunger. After searching for the softest stick on offer  I found my new bread friend and off we went to the checkout to pay.  There I was flying out the store with my french stick in my trolley amongst some other Tesco food goodies  when a elderly lady tripped over her basket and went flying. I sprung into quick action and saved her from a nasty fall and she was truly thankful (maybe you can print me a hero award or put me as customer as the month on a billboard outside the store?).  Anyway... upon returning home a unfortunate event happened. My partner was there juggling the shopping as he is too cheap to buy a 5p bag when BAM he dropped his Tesco finest dinner all over the floor... BAM the packaging split.... BAM his dinner was fit for the bin - lets not mention the mess he also created!  Anyway  forget him....  With the shock of the dinner falling to the floor  I dropped the french stick. It flew out the packaging and managed to slice open my thumb. It sliced like a knife! After spending hours trying to stop the bleed on my thumb and having to sit down and having a sugary drink and a few (a packet) biscuits... I am happy to say I am still alive and my thumb has not had to be amputated. I have enclosed a picture of my injury.  I know this accident could have been a whole lot worse and really I am thankful that my thumb has not fallen off but please can you ensure that there are no sharp bread bits on french sticks in the future.  Thank you loads   Helen  #frenchstickgate	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q83/s130x130/14355597_2274048276069445_3689288860685977415_n.jpg?oh=19722662f20dbda15af317dd5dff57dd&oe=58EFF76D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14355597_2274048276069445_3689288860685977415_n.jpg?oh=a8c99e42a1da661fd6e3b4919693197e&oe=5919B52F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2274048276069445&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-23T10:38:03+0000	1474627083	2016-09-23 12:38:03	10	5	17	0	22	5	5	0	4	0	10	1	1	5	0	0	0

You ve added 33% extra in to my punnet of raspberries.. except one of the extras was a little wasp. I m going to call her Wendy. So Wendy the wasp must of been so hungry that she flew in the punnet and not realised that you were going to add the plastic cellophane over the top. I think Wendy tried to escape through the holes but couldn t manage it as she had put on extra pudding due to eating most of my raspberries.. she must of got tired in the end and decided to have a little nap in one of the raspberries and unfortunately she must of died due to a food coma. I ve added a picture of Wendy and hope that someone recognises her and passes the message on to her family that she sadly passed away and if someone could ask them how she wanted her funeral. I know she would want to be buried under a raspberries bush  but that s where you come in Tesco  you see  my raspberries were reduced to £1.64 when they wasn t out of date  did you know about Wendy? Is that why you reduced them? What I m trying to say is... are you going to fund the funeral? The raspberry bush?   Kind regards  Wendy s adoptive Mum  (Not by choice)	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14441058_1131719036908057_5887572963945609636_n.jpg?oh=2a3313ebf035b3fba916a72a658540a9&oe=58D88B9E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14441058_1131719036908057_5887572963945609636_n.jpg?oh=dc7ccb63b6b918ecb6dcb5950d6288ed&oe=58E4238B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1131719036908057&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-23T09:21:14+0000	1474622474	2016-09-23 11:21:14	3	4	4	0	8	3	3	0	1	0	3	0	0	1	0	0	0

Shopping with baby girl  nature called needed to use washroom facilities. As baby change had no toilet sought to use disabled WC so I could take my pram in. For security reasons it s kept locked. Found security guard to request if he could unlock it. He had the worst attitude ever making me feel extremely uncomfortable. I offered him the opportunity to check my pram storage basket as I had just walked into the store and it was empty. He tuts at me! Then says in the most impolite of tones  why can t you use the normal toilets?!  Absolutely horrified at his stupidity I point out I have a child who I can t leave outside as it s unsafe. He responds by kissing his teeth and giving me a dirty look!!!!  Tesco were informed and could not muster any form of apology. Despite contacting them several times. Fobbing me off with  we re investigating   it s been passed on   it s resolved by the store . Actually it s not resolved because no one from the store or head office has contacted me. Simply awful.					2016-09-23T08:53:16+0000	1474620796	2016-09-23 10:53:16	3	4	3	4	11	4	2	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am extremely embarrassed after a recent visit to your Bolton Store!  I went to purchase a new apple TV as shown on your display in store and was asked to pay £129. When I challenged the price as the shelf said £59 I was told that the picture used by tesco is incorrect and that it should reflect the old model and not the new. As you can see from my photo attached  there is a clear difference between old and new models by the remote control.  When speaking to the duty manager of the store (Clive J) he did agree where the confusion was but was not willing to sell at the price advertised of £59.

Have to say was a bit gutted...  Not half as much as my daughter who couldn t find a card for  sister  without it being bright pink or overly girly.😞 my eldest megan has actually asked me to message  the tesco  and ask why all your sister cards are so girly? Her younger sister loves dinosaurs  rolling in mud football and collecting pebbles 🤔 not sure where that has come from.  But would rather scratch her eyes out than have a girly anything at the moment..... I know it is a push to get anything dinosaur related that isn t aimed at boys... But I honestly don t have an explanation for my 8 year old why tesco seem to think all girls are girly and love pink  sparkles and fluffy cats.... The only one that wasn t overly girly was  far too grown up for Mollie  << Megan s words. We ended up ditching the sister card idea and went for a 6 spider man card.  That said I m holding out hope that you do infact sell something that would suit a  tomboy  daughter.   Could you advise on if you do sell daughter cards aimed at more tomboys? And also if you do any dinosaur clothing for girls? Xx			http://section.pr/	section.pr	2016-09-22T21:01:41+0000	1474578101	2016-09-22 23:01:41	4	2	4	0	6	2	2	0	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was lunch time so I looked for a place to feed her. Harris and Hoole was full so I went into Giraffe and asked if I could sit to feed my daughter. I was told no as it was a restaurant  I needed to order something. I was most shocked to be spoken to like that and quite upset as my daughter was clearly unhappy and hungry.  Feeling humiliated I went back into Tesco and asked at customer services if there was somewhere I could feed my daughter. The lady said the baby room and took me. To say I was disgusted is an understatement. It was dark  small and stank from the nappy bin. I refused to feed my daughter there and was forced to go and sit outside.   I have been using this store for years and never have I been so disappointed  upset or humiliated. Why Tesco thinks it s acceptable to feed a child in a dark smelly room is beyond me. I would like to see the Tesco staff sit and eat in there. In future I will be feeding my daughter before shopping and certainly will not be going into Giraffe again.					2016-09-22T20:11:30+0000	1474575090	2016-09-22 22:11:30	6	73	21	19	113	71	24	47	120	0	6	0	3	0	1	11	0

First of all thanks for your grocery deliveries  we ve been problem free for months & your drivers are always so polite which saves us the trek around Tesco with little ones in tow.  Sadly today we have issues though. The carrots that were delivered aren t particularly nice and look like something has been living in at least one of them (can only hope it s no longer there given the beastie phobia!) and they stink. This has also made everything that was in the bag with them stink and a bag & contents that must have been in contact with this stink aswell - to the point I d rather bin the contents than put them in the cupboard.   Is there a way to get a refund for these items? Teething baby makes a phone call to customer services slightly difficult. Thanks.					2016-09-22T20:08:16+0000	1474574896	2016-09-22 22:08:16	1	7	1	0	8	7	1	6	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We called the number given on the website and were told to book an appointment online. We went online and were told there were no appointments and we had to call the number we had just called to book an appointment. It doesn t take brain of Britain to work out that if we will do that we will be in a never ending circle of calls.  The store in question is Whitstable.

I queried this with staff who agreed I was right and the ticket was incorrect. They tried to find the correct size box for me but after waiting over 20 minutes I was told there was nothing they could do as the ticket was a  head office mistake . The manager  Andy  refused to compensate and give me the 4 cans that I was owed. Really  with the profits made by Tesco I honestly thought you could have made up the 4 cans and I would have left a happy customer. This time I just feel like I ve been treated unfairly and I ve paid for something I didn t get. It s left a bad taste!

I ve had my foot op and I m now home and I m very very disappointed.  This is not the level of customer service that I expect from TESCO.  Appalling customer service from Tesco Direct. Ordered a new Sim- only mobile on 18/9 for delivery 20/9 at my local Click and Collect store. on 20/9 I get an email saying sorry  it s been delayed  will be there tomorrow (today). So today I waited and waited for the confirmation e-mail - nothing - not even another  sorry email . I decide to check online to see what has happened to my order. Status says  not dispatched . So I phone customer services  wait ages to get through  she doesn t know  she ll contact the  partner company . Then I just get put through and have to go through the whole story again. Appliances Direct lady says my order isn t showing on their system so she can t help. I ask to be transferred back to Tesco Direct. I speak to a gentleman  who after a bit of investigation  assures me my phone was delivered to the C&C at 11am this morning. However  when the very helpful gentleman at the C&C tries to find my order in store  there is no sign of it. I come back home and phone the Tesco Direct customer services again & go through the security for the 4th time. After speaking to a supervisor  the customer services assistant says unfortunately there s nothing they can do as Appliances Direct are now shut until tomorrow. Now tomorrow I am having an operation and I wanted to have this phone while I was in hospital to play around with and familiarise myself with the new functions  it is a foot operation so I won t be able to walk or drive to collect this phone and it is likely I ll still be in hospital when anyone phones back to let me know the outcome. The money  of course  was taken from my credit card immediately. TESCO - this is not good enough - I went through your website because I thought it would give me piece of mind that my phone would be delivered on on the day stated. You are obviously only interested in getting my hard-earned money and not in good customer service - many companies don t debit the account until the item has been dispatched. Don t use partner companies if they can t hold up to your usual standard of customer service. Please let me know what you intend to do about my phone - i don t care which colour I get  I just need a new phone to keep me in contact with my friends while I am stuck indoors after my operation.					2016-09-22T16:28:15+0000	1474561695	2016-09-22 18:28:15	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have tried to order in to store via a member of staff but have been told I am unable to do this  why? Why advertise a product that we are not able to purchase  apparently I was told a lady visited the Norton store yesterday with the same query  she is also unable to buy one! No doubt they will possibly be in stock when the money off voucher has expired!!!! Any help would be appreciated as some of your store staff are not very helpful at all!					2016-09-22T16:22:26+0000	1474561346	2016-09-22 18:22:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Sadly I d put my 13 month old son in it not realising it was broken until his finger got jammed in it . There was also several loose screws on the chair. I approached a member of staff who flippantly told me she d be there in a minute. 15 minutes later she still hasn t come and my sons food was delivered by another staff member so I brought it to her attention. She said  I ll take it away  sorry  and then proceeded to push the bar back in and just move it to a different place ! The screw that holds the bar in place is missing. Sorry to say I wasn t very happy about the way this was handled and only hope some other baby/toddler doesn t have a more serious accident !	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14358887_10205954795143994_6691746809169131752_n.jpg?oh=be44878577bffaaf8ef9e578367c3f43&oe=58EB4705	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14358887_10205954795143994_6691746809169131752_n.jpg?oh=9ff278c2633b146fe1d9ab69a50c7628&oe=58E64371	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205954795143994&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-22T15:45:34+0000	1474559134	2016-09-22 17:45:34	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I am so fed up of shopping at various Tescos and having abuse thrown at me for parking in a disabled bay.YES i do have a disabled blue badge which believe me is not simple to get but I do have a hidden disability.The signs only show a person in a wheelchair which unfortunately does not let people know that we do not have to be in a wheelchair to be disabled.  PLEASE PLEASE COULD YOU HAVE SIGNS UP OVER EACH PARKING BAY saying that not all disabilities are obvious as my shopping experiences are becoming a nightmare and making me feel so upset and anxious.  This really needs addressing as this is causing so much anxiety and stress for people who are not in wheelchairs or do not have obvious disabilities. I really look forward to your reply and I hope your company take the lead on this situation as it is also happening in other major shopping chains which I have also contacted.  I would be most happy to tell you exactly what has been going on if you would like to contact me as there is not just one incident.					2016-09-22T15:15:42+0000	1474557342	2016-09-22 17:15:42	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have this last week ditched a punnet of £3 Raspberries which went mouldy 24hrs before use by date. I have also recently returned a bag of brown onions which had turned 4 days before their date. Stock on the shelves on a number of items only have dates of 24-48 hours at best. I seem to be visiting more often buying smaller for fear of it going off. Is this a ploy to make the customer visit more frequently and boost profits? On another note  the remerchandising of the Dover store defies logic. Where the majority of tinned products used to be in close proximity  they are now spread several aisles apart  eg tin tomatoes one end of store  tin veg five aisles away.					2016-09-22T11:46:59+0000	1474544819	2016-09-22 13:46:59	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Maybe someone that views this page can get a message through to her or whoever is responsible for recruitment. I am trying to get through to a Gladys at the Enfield dot come centre to cancel a job interview today at 1pm  however was provided no number for the centre  cannot find it  and on calling the main switchboard twice  have been cut off in the process of transferring.   The job I applied for was listed as Harpenden  not Enfield  and was different hours to the ones I have been sent on the interview confirmation  which means I cannot do these shifts. I was also not informed the interview would be 4 1/2 hours. Whilst I have time this afternoon to come in for interview  I do not have a spare half a day.   Please contact Gladys at the Enfield dot com centre as your phone system has been unable to transfer me  and pass on my cancellation of the scheduled interview.

Mainly because living in Oakham you really do not have a choice at the moment. Thankyou Tesco for the parking fine this morning for out staying my welcome at your store. I can not wait until the other cheaper  value for money  FREE parkiing store is opened. You just lost my trade.

So yeah ok people get stuff in traffic etc  but it s not just an optician who works in there  there s also 2 Tesco assistants missing somewhere!! Great service hey!! Anyway I will now go elsewhere (at 38 weeks pregnant) to source some contact lenses!!   Whilst I m here  2 weeks ago I printed photos in your store and the machine broke. I expected some help from the customer service desk but no no  apparently you re in a war with timpsons regarding said machine so you can t touch it? What a joke!! I d rather they d have lied to me than told me office politics!! As the machine is situated in a Tesco  you d think you d be responsible for it?

So put the phone down) saying they couldn t find the transaction on the club card. I know 100% I used that card to purchased he kept saying well there s nothing I can do without proof of purchase. So I have gone into bank as I purchased the hudl in 2014 I didn t hold much hope of finding the transaction but I have 😁 so I now have proof of purchase! I emailed on Tuesday dinner to state I had proof & could someone contact me ASAP.

He told me I couldn t have a refund on the product as they had more in the fridge that weren t out of date .to which I replied I didn t want another one regardless . The lady at customer services sorted out a goodwill voucher which was a nice gesture but I still obviously wanted a refund on the out of date product I had purchased .your employee was very rude at this point and said he had given me a goodwill gesture and that was all the goodwill I was receiving . Eventually I was refunded on the out of date product much to your customer service employees disgust . The rudeness of the staff last night was disgusting it wasn t my fault they are selling out of date smoothies but I know I m entitled to a refund . If this is how staff are trained to talk to customers I m disgusted and considering shopping in the local asda instead where I know the staff are not rude and certainly don t speak to their customers in that manner for something that isn t the customers fault . Maybe your staff need to be re trained on customer service matters and realise that selling out of date products is illegal and NOT the customers fault but the stores fault . I expect to be treated with respect when shopping in your stores and not in the manner I was . This situation will be escalated to head office as a serious complaint also . Disgusted doesn t even come close to how I feel .					2016-09-22T05:40:34+0000	1474522834	2016-09-22 07:40:34	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s a residential area  surrounded by houses and I don t understand how you can get away with this. It s been going on a long time now. Engine noise  coupled with rattling cages and the beeping of the trucks reversing. I would be grateful if you can look into the legalities of this and get it sorted out. I will also be speaking to my local council environmental health officer.					2016-09-22T01:37:16+0000	1474508236	2016-09-22 03:37:16	3	16	3	0	19	16	5	11	6	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

No offence but I am  paying all this money on rent to live near the city campus at Worcester and Tescos Express (the building underneath our flats) on Foregate street are doing construction at 12 in the night?! At 1:30 we asked them to keep it down and we are met with rudeness?! We are all awake in the building and will be till 6am  apparently  as that is when we finish?!  We all have to get up early for lesson tomorrow morning and all management can do is close the door and say we were warned... when?! There was no letter through the door or any verbal warning when I was in the shop yesterday! My fellow students in the building and I are all paying  £9000 a year for our education and no one can sleep  meaning our early morning will be hard.  One of my flat mates is trying to catch a train home in the hope of getting a little sleep tonight!!! We had no warning  no letter through the door nothing  we would have understood if there was warning or maybe an explanation on why they are disturbing our sleep?! If this was the other way around we as students would be put through the ringer. I am not exaggerating the amount of noise  as being on the first floor flat my flat mates and I are beyond disappointed by the response we have had from Tescos  the university security and police and we will all be making formal complaints to Tesco and the Council.

I feel that the users of this store are being classed as undervalued shoppers. The magazine has money off coupons inside and again we are not able to access this. This store at Alver Village in Gosport is a superstore so surely it should have the magazine.					2016-09-22T01:10:03+0000	1474506603	2016-09-22 03:10:03	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I order my shop to arrive tonight in between 9-10pm. At 10.15 I called customer services as my shopping hadn t arrived at that time and was told it will take only 20 min. At 10.55pm I rang again and was told our food wasn t going to arrive at all tonight. Then the call got cut off and I couldn t talk to anybody again (lines were closed). Nobody was decent enough to give me a call and I only found out when I called.  Thanks to Tesco I have nothing to give my children for breakfast tomorrow. You made my week. Your service is apalling.

What I don t appreciate is poor customer service. I found a lovely coat in your shop (southend store) that I wanted to get the girls. There was one of each size on the rail which again i understand as the rails are only a certain size. After wandering around for five minutes to try and find someone to ask to have a look out the back for a second of the same size I gave up and went to customer services. Upon asking the lady if she could have a look I was greeted by a short  I can t leave the desk  strange thing to say I thought to myself  surely you can help your customer?? Anyway I asked if she could find someone to have a look for me. At this point I was told everyone in clothing had gone home and only they could access the area with clothing in. Again a strange response surely someone in the store can access this  isn t this what managers are for? Worse still I was then asked what the time was and upon answering 20 past nine I was told  Well if you want to go and do some more shopping there might be someone here about quarter to.  I asked how would I know who to look for only to be told   they will be around somewhere  great customer service... fed up with the less than helpful attitude of this lady I went and done some more shopping  came back and couldn t find anyone. I went back to customer services thinking I could ask the less than helpful worker (because of course she couldn t leave the desk she would be there) only to find that she wasn t there... she was wandering round another part of the store. I regularly spend a lot of money in tesco not only on food but many items for my girls including baby food nappies and clothing. Is this the sort of service that tesco pride themselves on? Am I a valued customer? Is it really that difficult to have an assistant help me when trying to make a purchase? I have been at work all day and can only shop this late as I don t have any other spare time to do this. Needless to say it was not a pleasant experience and you have lost out on a dual purchase for your poor customer service and it makes think why would I return to your store if this is how I am treated!!!!					2016-09-21T21:35:54+0000	1474493754	2016-09-21 23:35:54	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He genuinely went above and beyond to help solve an issue no one else in-store or online had been able to help with or even offer any advice for. He really does deserve recognition so if you could pass on my heartfelt thanks - I would be very grateful!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14344065_10100159992276358_7061667650778451691_n.jpg?oh=43f754fed1ddf82af391b25b15dddaba&oe=5921A6A7	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14344065_10100159992276358_7061667650778451691_n.jpg?oh=4bb2aaaa26d2381eed4be968ea75be82&oe=58E888AA	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100159992276358&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-21T21:27:44+0000	1474493264	2016-09-21 23:27:44	9	1	10	0	11	1	1	0	2	0	9	1	0	0	0	0	0

It rained today so I took out the packet  allowed it to thaw and have just opened it to cook them. It appears the loin was not chopped  just boned and rolled. Doubtless a fine piece of meat once cooked  which will take probably 40 minutes longer than I intended. I ll have this for lunch tomorrow. I m looking forward to it.

Tesco  I ve found your ace delivery driver but he doesn t even work for you! The agency driver that brought my groceries this evening was the first driver since I can t remember when to ask where I wanted my shopping and to bring it into the kitchen for me. Other drivers simply pile all the trays right in front of the door before ringing the bell so they can t. This evening s driver also made certain that I understood the  as fresh as you d pick yourself  guarantee  the bag recycling scheme (and that you don t take money from it and it goes to charity).   If only I could choose my delivery slot by driver! He was the best driver I ve ever had deliver.

As a new mum I was at my local Lesmahagow store with my 3 week old baby on Friday the 16th of September  this was one of my first outings with my baby alone. We happily went round the store but by the time I got to the check out my baby was getting very distressed and as a result so was I.  Your staff could not have been any more helpful as one woman that works there called Audrey (who I only realised after she had helped hadn t even started her shift yet) approached me and offered to put my shopping on the check out for me  whilst another rang them through. Another woman called Fiona then came up and helped me with my baby  as a first time mum I was very happy to welcome any help being given to me.  Not only did they help me in store they both walked me to my car and helped me load  my groceries. I feel they were very friendly and went over and above their duties to go out of their way to help me. I was just wondering if there was any way these 2 individuals could get the recognition they deserve.  All staff in the Lesmahagow branch are very friendly but these 2 ladies were fantastic to me and certainly made a time that was very stressful for me much easier.  I think they done a fantastic job and should be praised for the kind lovely helpful ladies they are  they are an absolute credit to your store. I would appreciate it greatly if they could some how get this message or inform me as to how i can contact the specific store myself with a customer comments scheme of some form.   Thanks again for all your help 😀  Linsey					2016-09-21T19:42:05+0000	1474486925	2016-09-21 21:42:05	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please give him my thanks as I didn t shine my lights quick enough to say thank you ☺					2016-09-21T19:35:30+0000	1474486530	2016-09-21 21:35:30	52	11	59	9	79	11	8	3	16	0	52	7	0	0	0	0	0

I thought that this was supposed to be cancelled the day after I left  or does it carry on till expiry? Also  could you advise how long it will take for a P45 to come through  as I would like to get it to my new employer asap so that I don t get hit for emergency tax when I am paid next month. Thanks!					2016-09-21T19:34:12+0000	1474486452	2016-09-21 21:34:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Id be up for buying n extra meal deal for a homeless person... and it could be super easy - it could just be a receipt with a barcode which we could just gift it to someone who needs it. I m probably just brain farting but thought id try. Kel x					2016-09-21T18:58:27+0000	1474484307	2016-09-21 20:58:27	8	2	9	4	15	2	1	1	0	0	8	1	0	0	0	0	0

After listening to people rave about your school uniform basics I thought I would buy a pack of two polos for my son. I m really glad I only bought one pack! After one wash  at 30 degrees not at 40 degrees your garment label states you can see that the one on the left has shrunk considerably! It no longer fits my son properly and he looks ridiculous! He hasn t actually worn it yet!  I took these back into my local store today only to be told by the member of staff on the service desk that  it wasn t her problem!  Well quite frankly I think as an employee of Tesco  if a customer comes in and complains then it is her problem! I ve bought a product from you which is clearly faulty  therefore it is her problem! She then went onto say that if I had read the washing instructions this wouldn t have happened! I won t detail the exact reply she got from me  but from the shocked and slightly upset expression I m sure she realised that her comment REALLY annoyed me!  I understand that as I no longer have the receipt I cannot get a refund  but I d like to return these based on the fact that they are a faulty product that no longer serves its purpose!  Please contact me regarding this matter.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14390750_10154230549095141_5035165797748017152_n.jpg?oh=6fca22db52cdde0aa160579d9b94e61f&oe=58E542C1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14390750_10154230549095141_5035165797748017152_n.jpg?oh=d76c902b19be7efcecb79a07adfac031&oe=58E072CC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154230549095141&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-21T18:50:01+0000	1474483801	2016-09-21 20:50:01	11	9	14	2	25	9	3	6	7	0	11	0	1	0	0	2	0

I realised when returning home tonight I had left my keys in Costa based within your Northwich store. I googled the store to only be able to gain a call centre number no direct line to the store or Costa. I explained what had happened and that I was currently locked out of my house with two small children  he then explained he needed to call then store on my behalf they would then speak to Costa staff and call me back  after 20 minutes no returned call so I decided to travel to the store with both children and locate the keys myself (which I did Costa staff  where excellent) I have just received a call from the call centre to say they were unable to contact the store and Costa is now closed. Glad I drove down there and wasn t still waiting on my door step 2 hours later please can you explain why you don t share direct numbers as I am sure it would be a lot easier for everyone!					2016-09-21T18:35:46+0000	1474482946	2016-09-21 20:35:46	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This morning my food shopping arrived  and half of it had been handed out to the previous customer. They then arranged to re pick the missing items and have it dropped off just after 6pm. Well it s arrived an hour late  the delivery guy didn t knock on my door but slammed my letter box twice waking my twin five year olds up (who have school in the morning) and was rude to me when I asked him if in future he could knock on the door rather than slam the letterbox! AND there are STILL items missing from my shopping!!! Great customer service Tesco! Well done! 👏🏻👏🏻					2016-09-21T18:16:48+0000	1474481808	2016-09-21 20:16:48	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can not get to your store to complain or get a refund so I really hope you can help me here.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14449056_1091436390941862_7150177801671110771_n.jpg?oh=e9016726e2ff726f3a8455062f6cedc3&oe=58EA8B59	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14449056_1091436390941862_7150177801671110771_n.jpg?oh=91f8f82dd51fc53273cc4fe7bca59a5b&oe=58D6B14C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1091436390941862&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-21T17:58:55+0000	1474480735	2016-09-21 19:58:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I spent half the night awake last night due to knowing I had the dreaded dentist this morning 😢 my biggest phobia EVER... I  would rather give birth to triplets in a field with no pain relief than willingly have someone yank my teeth out of my jaw bone  but the thing that kept me going was knowing I could sit and eat  when I say eat I mean dribble (due to injections) your finest chicken soup... So reluctantly I cook a hearty meal for the family (I m quietly sobbing now as it smells amazing) and then I get ready to heat up my yummy soup.... I pull open the lid and take a big sniff (the smell of sage is yummy in it) and then I nearly heave all over the kitchen floor... It doesn t smell quite like normal :( once pouring the can into the saucepan I can see why... There is a massive lump of mould in it and all around the tin... So now I shall sit and dribble some yummy water and feel very sorry for myself for the rest of the evening...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14445950_10210426936812334_6136976855967978903_n.jpg?oh=e9e39a52ddbe06349d3a37acf2a3e82e&oe=58DD14E9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14445950_10210426936812334_6136976855967978903_n.jpg?oh=c8d8851c768f19b3e9967cb3296945eb&oe=58EC4AE4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210426936812334&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-21T17:24:42+0000	1474478682	2016-09-21 19:24:42	2	23	9	0	32	23	7	16	7	0	2	0	5	0	0	2	0

Ordered a new Sim- only mobile on 18/9 for delivery 20/9 at my local Click and Collect store. on 20/9 I get an email saying sorry  it s been delayed  will be there tomorrow (today).  So today I waited and waited for the confirmation e-mail - nothing - not even another  sorry email . I decide to check online to see what has happened to my order. Status says  not dispatched . So I phone customer services  wait ages to get through  she doesn t know  she ll contact the  partner company . Then I just get put through and have to go through the whole story again.  Appliances Direct lady says my order isn t showing on their system so she can t help. I ask to be transferred back to Tesco Direct.  I speak to a gentleman  who after a bit of investigation  assures me my phone was delivered to the C&C at 11am this morning. However  when the very helpful gentleman at the C&C tries to find my order in store  there is no sign of it.  I come back home and phone the Tesco Direct customer services again & go through the security for the 4th time. After speaking to a supervisor  the customer services assistant says unfortunately there s nothing they can do as Appliances Direct are now shut until tomorrow. Now tomorrow I am having an operation and I wanted to have this phone while I was in hospital to play around with and familiarise myself with the new functions  it is a foot operation so I won t be able to walk or drive to collect this phone and it is likely I ll still be in hospital when anyone phones back to let me know the outcome.  The money  of course  was taken from my credit card immediately. TESCO - this is not good enough - I went through your website because I thought it would give me piece of mind that my phone would be delivered on on the day stated. You are obviously only interested in getting my hard-earned money and not in good customer service - many companies don t debit the account until the item has been dispatched. Don t use partner companies if they can t hold up to your usual standard of customer service. Please let me know what you intend to do about my phone - i don t care which colour I get  I just need a new phone to keep me in contact with my friends while I am stuck indoors after my operation.					2016-09-21T17:07:26+0000	1474477646	2016-09-21 19:07:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been a loyal customer for over 40 years. No longer.  The products I used to buy every week have now been discontinued  even though they were popular  admitted by one store manager. I can buy them on line if I like. No thank you. If you buy stuff on  line  you get no choice as to what they deliver to you  as found out from experience.  Sorry  we do not have that item  but we sent you this instead  and we have charged you for it!   Sell by dates are getting shorter and shorter and the fresh food is anything but! Fresh that is! And offers are anything but offers. A friend posted this today (I m sure she won t mind me passing this on.)   Really annoyed with TESCO S. Last week I needed to buy my usual Quaker Oats but noticed that the price had jumped from £1.09 to £1.99 (nearly double). They had then put a  special offer  notice next to it of 2 for £3. I m sure that you don t need me to work out the maths for you. Obviously  I didn t buy it  but went to Morrison s where I bought it for £1 a packet  (cheaper than Tesco s normal price). Today  I went again to Tesco s to do my weekly shop and just thought that I would check the price of the Quaker Oats. It was still on the  so-called  offer. Upon mentioning it to a member of staff and telling them that it was a total RIP-OFF and a CON  the answer was   Yes  I know. They all do it!  Come on  TESCO S. This is not fair on your loyal customers and do you really think that we are all totally gullible and stupid? How many other items  (some probably far more expensive)  have had the same  special offers ? STOP RIPPING-OFF your customers!   Ive given up now and shop at Lidl most of the time....					2016-09-21T16:32:51+0000	1474475571	2016-09-21 18:32:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On the main page I was presented with the option of 3 e coupons  to be used on 3 different shops  the first one being  TDX-WFRX  for £5 off a £40 spend and valid to be used at the checkout. My husband has just been to our local Tesco store in Burnley and was told by an assistant that it was a scam. But as these coupons are appearing on Tesco s own site we are wondering how it could possibly be a scam. Please could you verify whether these coupons are genuine. If they are genuine can they only be used on line or is it possible to print them out and use them in store.					2016-09-21T16:17:53+0000	1474474673	2016-09-21 18:17:53	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A kind stranger handed it in. My daughter was moving back to Sheffield for University that day and did not realise she had lost it. The finder contacted her via Facebook to let her know it had been found. When we went today to collect it we were told it had been destroyed.

I come out of a store today to see the security guard with a clipboard looking through the window of my car. Unfortunately I didn t get to approach him regarding this as I will dealing with my 3 month old baby boy.   The only evidence on show in my car that I have a baby with me is a sign in the rear window saying  baby on board . Am I supposed to have a big sign inside saying  yes I do have a child ?					2016-09-21T16:05:28+0000	1474473928	2016-09-21 18:05:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You have been my major supermarket for more years than I can remember  I even fill in your questionnaires about my visits  and they are normally good  but today that s it - we are over.  My partner who lives in Scotland but stays here more than half the year did an online order for £80  paying on her card and her account to have it delivered to my address  as she does often  and when she tried to use my voucher for this address it wouldn t take it. She phoned your customer services (ha! that s a laugh) and was told she couldn t use it  so she cancelled the order telling the lady we wouldn t shop with you anymore - she didn t care!   Well I don t either so all my food shopping instead of going to you is now going to go to Asda or Sainsbury s  both of which are nearer anyway - farewell Tesco  at least it s not a long drawn out divorce!					2016-09-21T15:49:19+0000	1474472959	2016-09-21 17:49:19	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At approximately 13:30 I went to your Tesco express store on 780-790 Bath Rd  Hounslow TW5 9SL. The member of staff whose behavioural issues I have already raised with Tesco was once again manning the till; there was a G4S man working under the till; and all tills was closed for what would be a few seconds; this cashier who did have a name badge on this time (Beatrice) said to the people waiting at the front of the queue  its not working  and pointed to the self service; I then approached the till and pointed to the bottle of whiskey and said that i would pay on self service. the abrupt reply from beatrice was  its not working  i said yes i know if u hand me the item in question ill pay for it on self service; again the abrupt reply was  its not working  at this point the manager ok d her to use the till she in her usual rude manner said  which one u want  I named the brand and said i would like the small one; she automatically picked the biggest bottle and i again reiterated  the small one  this time she picked the second largest; I realised at this time she was being difficult on purpose (which coincidently was why I complained about her the first time around) I had to correct her a third time at which point she complained that I had not told her the exact volume of the bottle; I was beginning to loose my cool with her at this point and said  you are being difficult as usual  I than looked at the manager and said  are you the manager  to which he replied  yes ; I said to him this member of staff has an attitude problem and is consistently rude to customers; at this point beatrice chimed in and said  NO U ARE RUDE!!!  i looked at the manager and said  are u just going to stand there mate or do u have something to say  he just kept starring blankly in front of him as if he didn t know what to do; I said to beatrice  i will complain to the head office about this  and her blatant reply was  you can complain as much as you like ; the manager till standing there pretending he can t see or hear anything. Normally i would hand he money to the cashier but i was so furious with her and the lack of intervention from her manager that i dropped the cash on the till rather than handing it over  beatrice at this point again in an aggressive manner said  don t you throw money at me  clearly she doesn t know what throwing money at someone or something really means; i d had enough of her by this time and said to manager could you at least come over and serve me; which he did. having raised a similar issue with a manager in the branch before; the manager who on this occasion was stocking just briefly looked at me and said  yeah sorry bout that  and than turned and started stocking the shelfs again and only agreed to speak with beatrice when he was contacted by your head office about the complain; however this time round it was even worse; the manager was right there and made no attempt to intervene and take over the situation at any point (i didn t get his name but would describe him as a young asian guy wearing thick rimmed glasses; there are about 7 other shops in the immediate vicinity of your tesco who are family run businesses and realise being rude to customers will hit your profits; your shop however is staffed by rude cashiers driving business away and a useless management who seems unable to do anything about them; and since you are employing and paying this person to be the face of tesco I will make sure that you don t only loose out on getting my money but also share this experience with as many people as possible to insure you loose thousands of pounds because of this one member of staff.					2016-09-21T13:39:39+0000	1474465179	2016-09-21 15:39:39	0	13	0	0	13	13	3	10	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My eldest son turned five today and wanted to take a cake to school to celebrate with his friends ... unfortunately  he is gluten free so it s not so easy. However  last year you solved this problem and had a delicious gf chocolate celebration cake which he took into nursery. Yesterday  we popped along to grab another for this birthday and found they have been discontinued! I ended up baking and decorating a cake for him at midnight which was definitely not in my pre-birthday plans! Please  please  please bring them back!  PS.

Taking Maltesers as an example  you charge:  * 97.1p per 100g for 103g  * £1.25 per 100g for 120g  * £1.36 per 100g for 184g.   This is a stroke of genius and should be applauded. I hope the other supermarkets take note and follow suit.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14446048_10154431447972457_1306782139054482539_n.jpg?oh=79f039ddb0439d30f0fdca594d581029&oe=58DA475D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14446048_10154431447972457_1306782139054482539_n.jpg?oh=4bd6ae1f336af177b6eaad427e17515f&oe=58DC6B50	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154431447972457&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-21T12:10:28+0000	1474459828	2016-09-21 14:10:28	0	4	2	1	7	4	2	2	1	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0

Used to buy a 90p bag of fruit (mainly melon with a few other cheap fruits) but have now discovered that you have doubled the size of the bag and knocked the price up to £3 whilst adding a few (and I mean a few) tiddly little sour looking strawberries. This is the way you seem to be going. Your profits and sales fell so you took it upon yourselves to simply increase prices whilst stating that you were decreasing your offers to concentrate on reducing your fresh prices. This apparent reduction in offers seems to have spread to your everyday cheaper items which you are jiggling with to try and fool people. Uncle Ben microwave rice used to be a regular offer at 99p yet now the offer is buy 2 for £3. You got rid of Bisto ready meals that were 99p and replaced them with you own (very low meat but not bad tasting) meals. You are slowly but surely bringing yourselves up to the price point that Sainsbury s have driven me away with and Lidl s is starting to once again become an attractive option. Your apparent sales increase of late is  in my opinion  driven more by price increases than by a new formula that is winning you back customers.

I returned a rug doctor cleaner and the lock was broken on the locker so I informed customer services as proof I had returned it.   After waiting a few minutes for Gill and Joanna to finish their conversation I spoke to Gill and told her the problem. I was immediately met with  it s nothing to do with us  and I would have to inform rug doctor themselves! I m sorry  it was rented from Tesco! Why should I have to inform them? I only wanted a slip of paper saying I had returned it.   After numerous attempts to tell Gill I was a customer of the store and Tesco logos are plastered all over the lockers a manager was called.  He assured me he would contact rug doctor  took a picture of it and acknowledged it was returned. Why couldn t this be done in the first place?    Very disappointed especially as these women are your customer service team! Not great customer service I m sure you ll agree. I  eagerly await your response.

My son is a very small 3 year old and still fits in most 2-3 clothes. I m finding recently that 3-4 are smaller on him than his 2-3. I m having to buy him 4-5 years to fit him. Every other store he is only just in 3-4. It s disappointing  really as  I can t just pick a size with the confidence that it will fit.					2016-09-21T08:01:01+0000	1474444861	2016-09-21 10:01:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was driving in the Tonbridge/West Malling direction in the one way system through Maidstone when suddenly there was a trolley you use to carry your crates flying towards me outside McDonald s on the main road. Luckily it wasn t going fast and all cars were able to swerve around it. As I drove past I noticed a pedestrian walk into the road and take it onto the path. From there on I flashed  honked and indicated to the driver of the van the trolley came out of until he pulled over in Callisto Court where this young lad was worried to be told that he had lost a piece of equipment. I am only posting this as I do hope a message can be passed on that I hope I didn t scare him by flashing and honking  and I apologise if I had. Also  no accidents were caused because of it (fortunately) so I would love it if he was told about that too!!

I purchased an Xbox One S from Tesco Brooklands  I paid some of the cost in Tesco clubcard vouchers and some on my debit card. I ordered this at the click and collect counter. The transaction was voided twice! I have 2 transaction void receipts. The Lady at the Click and Collect counter assured me that the money would not come out of my account as I had the voided receipts. Today I get an email from my bank saying I have no money in the account. On further investigation on my part I see the transaction has come out 3 times from Tesco. I have spoken to a gentleman in Customer Service this morning at 11am - he said he would call me back.  Still no call!!!! I have then called back Tesco 3 times today and gone over the story as many as well! As no-one was calling me!! Tescos are now telling me that the money is being refunded by my bank not them.  This is not the case as my bank has authorised the payment to Tesco and the money has left my account.  No refund will be coming to me from my bank. I am out of pocket £213 today and have no money to buy food for my family tonight as a result!!! I shop at Tesco everyday and see this as very poor customer service! How are you going to resolve the situation? I have been told by Tesco Brooklands that I have to schlep over to them for them to credit me with the funds as it cannot be done over the phone!  So I have to take time out of my day  use my petrol and valuable working day time to rectify a Tescos mistake.  They have said they can offer me £20 voucher and a bunch of flowers as a way of apology. I do not see this as good enough.   Seeing as I have no money today to buy food  have DDs going out of my account which may not go out due to current lack of funds!   What can you do as ways of compensation?					2016-09-20T20:30:05+0000	1474403405	2016-09-20 22:30:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Casually buying long life milk as you do assuming that the description is in the name....long life.... Just about to put it in a cupboard at my sons so that finally he will have milk in for when I next visit when I notice the date..... It seemed to jumped out at me 12 Aug 16... hmmm that can t be right as it was 18 sept 16 that I made my purchase. It then had me thinking with the long life it has on the milk originally (6 to 9 months) how long had that carton actually been sat on your shelves and were there more 😳.... also how had this happened? Surely Tesco implements stock rotation in ALL it s stores? To be honest this is not the first time this has happened with products from Tesco 1st time I passed it off as an accident 2nd time frustrating but again overlooked it. Now it seems that it s clearly not an isolated incident but sheer negligence. Yes it was only a mere carton of milk which I noticed and managed not to consume. BUT.... what if someone was to get very sick from an out of date product that Tesco couldn t be bothered to stock rotate or throw out when clearly out of date. A day or 2 is understandable but this was well over a month 😱 Yes my money was refunded but does this make it acceptable?  Tesco you really need to step up your game because this is disgraceful 😞 A disappointed customer	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14432972_10153904894973715_5722232272263584226_n.jpg?oh=08a59ca65e0e2f5341bd797c50009591&oe=5922B46B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14432972_10153904894973715_5722232272263584226_n.jpg?oh=dc76608d3874dcd0196f0c8d2b6fc605&oe=58F01666	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153904894973715&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-20T20:26:57+0000	1474403217	2016-09-20 22:26:57	1	5	3	0	8	4	1	3	2	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0

I drove home which took a few minutes and put it back in the freezer. When I opened it this is what I was presented with. Melted ice cream which was more like milk. This was purchased from the walnut tree tesco express in milton keynes.  How is this even allowed to be sold when it s not frozen?

All I wanted was a replacement of a £5 Bluetooth GPS tracking Tag purchased from the petrol station that stopped working the next day  but all I got was   how do we know you bought it from here? you could have bought it from Morrisons or Asda for all we know   obviously if I had bought it from elsewhere I would be there asking for a replacement. I tried to explain my statutory rights as a consumer but all I got was  well I don t have any way to tell if it was bought from here so I can t do anything if you don t have the receipt or packaging . She then said if I didn t have a receipt i could show a bank statement to which I advised her that bank statements don t itemise items only what you paid  and she said well at least it would say Tesco petrol Station wouldn t it? I said yes it would but it wouldn t say what i bought  I said I ve just been to the petrol station now should I come back in a couple of days and show you that one? I even showed her my statutory rights of repair or replacement without a receipt or proof of purchase online  and she said that doesn t matter we teach our people to refuse without receipt or packaging. The thing is the packaging is universal so everywhere that sells these has the same packaging so again her argument was flawed. I asked that if i went to the citizens advice bureau what would they say  and she agreed that they would tell them to replace it but this didn t really matter as they just decide for themselves. In the end  I asked once again nicely and she agreed (on this occasion) to a replacement  but this was a very unpleasant experience over something that should have taken 2 minutes to resolve  not 3 visits and a conversation with a confrontational manager. She was already aware of the issue before speaking to me and so had already made her mind up as the staff from the Petrol station had spoken to her before I went to the store.					2016-09-20T17:36:44+0000	1474393004	2016-09-20 19:36:44	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would have thought your own store would price match your own online store. So I go to store to purchase a lego product where it is £35 in store but same product is £27.99 on Tesco direct. To be told I have to order via click and collect and they won t sell it for the same price. I understand you don t have to price match other companies but your own company is a joke! Before you tell me you are two different companies like I was just told in store that won t wash as you are quite happy to deliver products online to store to be picked up so not that much different in companies are you.					2016-09-20T17:14:37+0000	1474391677	2016-09-20 19:14:37	1	13	1	0	14	13	5	8	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

After dressing my three month old and actually managing to get out the door (any new mum will understand to get out the door is no mean feat)  I arrive at Tesco Aldershot feeling accomplished and ready to face the dreaded weekly shop  I get out my car to discover firstly the nearest single baby seat trolley to put my daughter in is a half mile away at the other end of the car park... So... I pull my sleeping child out of her car seat walk a marathon across the car park to get the trolley only to discover it s dirty and has a wonky wheel but at this point Iv just walked the length of the car park to get it so I carried on. Walking into the store I was on the look out for a different trolley I managed to find one (also dirty) but it s a double so it was about the size of a boat (I only have one small child) I placed her in it anyway as I thought it might be better and I just want to get shopping... it s no better still has a wonky wheel and still dirty but at this point I m getting fed up and my child is getting ratty with all the swapping seats. I got in and managed to get round the veg but after nearly taking out a bunch of other shoppers and my daughter becoming sea sick as the boat was such a bumpy ride I decided to ask the security guy to see if he could find me another trolley (he was the only staff member I could find) He came back with a double trolley also dirty and also with a wonky wheel!   Yes this is the third baby trolley I m on now!  At this point I m really fed up I just wanted to get in do my shop and get out  when I told the security guy that it s just as bad he advised me I just needed to walk around the store slowly.... Are you kidding me... I don t have time to pee by myself let alone walk around the store slowly!  I then found a Tesco staff member and told her it was unacceptable and asked her to remove the items from the self scanner as at this point I ve had enough and wanted to leave.   She arranged for me to speak to the duty manager who offered to find me another trolley ...my answer was NO!  He did apologise and advised me they should have new baby trollies arriving in store soon very helpful when I need to shop today!  The duty manager then turned to a cashier and asked her if they had any new baby trollies to which she stared blankly back at him 👌  I left the store with no shopping and feeling very deflated me and my husband are now very hungry this evening.  Thank you Tesco for a thoroughly  disappointing and frustrating trip 👍					2016-09-20T17:02:51+0000	1474390971	2016-09-20 19:02:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The e-mail with the order number and proof of id is apparently not enough. My question was if I am ill or housebound  then the only way of collecting it is to allow someone else my payment card? Apparently the answer is yes. Is this really the case Tesco?					2016-09-20T16:00:12+0000	1474387212	2016-09-20 18:00:12	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

(I ve lived in Stoke).  I witnessed (again) with my own eyes a woman leave a Tesco trolley outside my house (an able bodied woman riding a bike(yeah a bike(yeah she was pushing a trolley with a bike(How? Science B****))). Anyway  as I drove passed her to park my car  she looked a bit shifty  like she had been caught doing the deed  like the way someone looks when they ve been caught eating all your jaffa cakes that you bought for yourself and not you MIKE   I was sure that as I parked my car in the garage she would take it back.  PLOT TWIST: She didn t.  I watched her bike off into the sunset  with 2 bags on her handles. 2 Bags. TWO.BAGS. Probs some Fig biscuits (Tescos)  Loo roll and a copy of Grazia.  I ve setup closed circuit surveillance cameras at the perimeter of my house to catch this crazed animal walking passed. I ve also called Bill Oddie (an experienced bird watcher) to try to get a glimpse of who it was. Employing Oddies years of Birding  Sleepless nights and microwave meals (Tescos) for 2 have led to nothing. Apart from the terrible nausea (don t ask)  the only thing I caught was my gf going to the gym (again) with a very close friend of hers (male).  Bill has since quit birding.  It s been there ever since last Tuesday. Just sitting there  like a dead badger (minus the smell and general mess that a dead animal makes). It s now a scene of rage and anger  greeting me every morning I go to work  and every time I walk to Tesco PLC.   I wake up sweating  like a scene from hollywood when someone jolts forward out of bed with sweat dripping down their face  wishing I had never witnessed such a callous disgusting act.   I wonder sometimes  if I should go out and take in that badger and keep it as my own. But I know that the stench of it  I mean trolley not badger  would reek out my usually clean cream cotton curtains and cushiony carpet. (Usually Febreezed(Asdas (sorry was closer to work)).   I also wonder if on the 5 ocassions I ve walked to tescos since  that I should just push it there. But the thought of letting myself forgive her  really gets on my wick.  Anyway  I digress. I was just wondering how much your Tiger bread is?  Kidding  can you get one of the lads to come get it? (trolley). It s located at CB19GJ.

This order though has gone to my previous address....i had no idea i would have to change my address everytime i ordered. Now im contacting the person who lives there to see if my shopping has been delivered!					2016-09-20T15:49:28+0000	1474386568	2016-09-20 17:49:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

While I was busy getting my shopping in he took the time to chat with my 3 year old and even made him a ballon model dog.  This kind of added extra customer service is brilliant. Well done Simon  it may of been nothing to you. But you really helped me by distracting and interacting with my little boy.					2016-09-20T15:40:19+0000	1474386019	2016-09-20 17:40:19	3	3	3	0	6	3	1	2	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Apparently someone shopping in your store was just as excited at the prospect of Christmas cake as I was and decided to sample one  unfortunately the person picking my online order also chose that one to add to my shopping. You can imagine my utter devastation upon finding someone else had tasted it first. My cup of tea tasted lifeless without said anticipated cake.

The collection date was set as the 17th September which was the fastest I could find for the product  however I have now ended up waiting longer than it would have taken the other companies to have delivered.

Two weeks ago my three year old nearly choked on a large piece of wood in a packet of popcorn. I was told by customer services to take it into store and an investigation would be opened and I would hear back within 14 days. I still have not heard anything 16 days later and on calling to find out why  I find out the store didn t fill out the form properly and have said this had been resolved in store! To say I am furious  is an understatement  a three year old choking on wood to me is something that should be dealt with straight away?! I would appreciate a response as soon as possible.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14355565_10153743518432443_6905991253668893633_n.jpg?oh=5ef2b60b8b23bc20479b7fde3e030388&oe=58DDC1F5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14355565_10153743518432443_6905991253668893633_n.jpg?oh=31bffcf2055eb5421a86da20b3de946e&oe=58D748F8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153743518432443&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-20T12:05:56+0000	1474373156	2016-09-20 14:05:56	1	22	11	2	35	22	8	14	15	0	1	0	5	0	0	5	0

When I go into store I ask for an update  the staff have later called me to update and say head office are going to contact you. This still hasn t happened. Thought I d see if I get anywhere on here!

They said if you disagree we ll call the police.  I said sure go ahead.  They called the police and the police spoke to the Tesco manager and myself and told me Tesco had every right to refuse.  Okay I thought I ll call Sky. Before I did this the manager tells me that it s people of my ethnicity that have been coming into Tesco with fake vouchers!  I couldn t believe what he said.  He happily repeated it.  I m British Asian. The manager was black.  I would never dream of stereotyping him.  I spoke to Tesco customer services who rang the store.

But after this evening I m now thinking twice.  I bought some of your gluten free choco nut pillows. Which is definetly not krave.  This states in big letters  Gluten free  on the front.  Yet.... On the side. In small writing. States that it might not be suitable for celiacs as it contains oats.   Unfortunately I didnt read this until after I ate it and now am on a night shift with a stomach like a pregnant chihuahua and an explosive bottom.   Please can you change your policy to write in BIG LETTERS whether is is suitable for celiacs or not. To save my bottom and possibly many others who are newly diagnosed and love to eat cereal.   Kind regards a very bloated celiac sufferer					2016-09-20T00:47:19+0000	1474332439	2016-09-20 02:47:19	1	7	1	0	8	7	2	5	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had ordered some LR44 specialist flat batteries for my online banking card reader and you substituted them with ECO AA batteries. Ive tried every way possible to get the batteries into the tiny slots but they definately dont fit even if i stand them up on their end and then i cant get the back on the machine and have to put the machine face down on the table so i can balance the batteries on top of the tiny slots but then i cant put my card in upside down and i cant see the screen or press the buttons.   Im sure i must be doing something wrong.  could you give me instructions please on how i can get the AA s you sent me to work as a substitute for the LR44 s i ordered.

My 7 year old daughter chose some treats (after much deliberation I would like to add). We then went through the self serve till and because the product would not scan  the member of staff would not sell us the toys! I think they were a newly released product; but if they are on the shelf available to put in your basket then Tesco should at the minimum suck it up and take the hit and apologise for being so sloppy that they haven t got them ready on their till system. It s hard enough shopping with kids with all of the temptation supermarkets give them  let alone me telling her yes you can have it and then the mean Tesco lady telling her she can t!! No customer service  no extra mile  no nothing....just a crying 7 year old!! This is all she wanted....	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBTcM2m24gghOTd&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.toysrus.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fimages%2Flarge%2FTRUP2310850002_CF0001.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_hash=AQDciu29GG-XEU6O	https://external.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBXQYXXDFqSyr66&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.toysrus.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fimages%2Flarge%2FTRUP2310850002_CF0001.jpg&_nc_hash=AQASi3LpVVxpQUmj	http://www.toysrus.co.uk/mobile/toys/num-noms-series-2-mystery-pack/TRUP2310850002/CF0001?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping&utm_content=mobile&camp=CA%3Agoogle%3AMCF%3Amobile&gclid=CNym5omYnM8CFUHnGwodExcPlg	toysrus.co.uk	2016-09-19T19:45:11+0000	1474314311	2016-09-19 21:45:11	5	2	7	0	9	2	1	1	0	0	5	0	0	0	1	1	0

Bought a loaf of bread from the Rotherham store to get home and realise it was mouldy so called the store who told me I could take it back to any store as long as I had my receipt. Wath store being the closest I took it back there to be told I couldn t take it back there because it had to go on the other stores waste I explained the telephone call I had had with the lady at Rotherham and she said well I shouldn t be taking it back there still and it was a 50p loaf of bread what did I expect. It wasn t the money I was bothered about because yes 50p isn t a lot but it s the fact you buy something and expect it to be fresh. The ladies attitude was disgusting and very rude!					2016-09-19T19:39:15+0000	1474313955	2016-09-19 21:39:15	0	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

As you can also see most of them are mush! I bought these strawberries on Saturday in my  big shop  and they were the only variety with any shelf life to them. I am absolutely sick to death of how pathetic jubilee way tesco is in Mansfield. The other week it was shelves and shelves of 4pt 1% milk with less than a day of life and not even reduced! How is this fresh? Absolutely disgusting!

The process of updating address could take up to 6 weeks! I was advised that there is no way round it for groceries but if it was a Tesco Direct service then there is a “workaround”! What you’re telling me is I can order cookware and kitchenware but not FOOD! Great policy! And well done for going that extra mile to meet customer s needs.

I was going to purchase this online but since they were charging a £3 delivery fee I thought I d just pop to the store as it s close anyway. Luckily it was in store but charging £26?! I asked customer service and apparently there s a different price for items in store and online - is that really the case? If so  that s £6 difference from your online and in store cost making it a 33% markup which took me by surprise. So does this mean you mark up all your products in store by 33%? Surely if I can find the product instore I should just be able to pay the price advertised as you re just matching your own website? Is it not bad customer service for me to inconveniently go back home  purchase the product you already have in store and come back to pick it up?					2016-09-19T17:53:32+0000	1474307612	2016-09-19 19:53:32	0	6	0	0	6	6	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just faced every parents nightmare in one of your stores. My 3 year old chose some play dough as a treat. She carried it all round the store while we did our shop. Finishing we head to the tills  all fine until we got to scanning the said play dough 😨😱.  Your sales people could not find a price. After 5 mins of waiting they decided they couldn t sell me the precious playdough to me. Okay  so was hoping the meltdown didn t begin in the store..... Oooops it did!! Now there is no reasoning with a non-compliant toddler. As a result  I have an upset toddler & pretty certain I am now suffering from tinnitus 🙉!! Well done.

You also say you can t provide me with ANY OTHER proof of purchase! Or a dispatch note! Nowhere does it state when purchasing products that receipts need to be printed within 30 days.

Tesco very promptly got in touch and sent me a £5 money card in the post. Good customer relations I hear you say! Oh  no! When I have tried to use the money card on Saturday the 17th Sept it was empty! The cashier was very apologetic and suggested I try the customer services desk which I did. They rang through to Customer Services on my behalf who said that the money had been put onto the card and then taken off! They said they would credit the card and it would be available within the hour. This morning my husband tried it when he went shopping and lo and behold it was still empty! Not only that but the cashier threw the card away without informing my husband. Needless to say she had to get it back out of the bin! Please advise me what is going on! You ve got a very disgruntled customer.					2016-09-19T16:28:52+0000	1474302532	2016-09-19 18:28:52	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I feel now after several mails and posts I can skip the formality of using your full name and abbreviate. I wanted to let you know things have taken a more sinister turn. As you know from one of my other correspondence it was my sons birthday party on Friday night. The Mattresses I have accumulated due to your incompetence were stored in my unborn babies room. I had told the kids to stay out of said room. Anyway  today my friend contacted me to say her 5 year old daughter hasn t returned home from school. After a mass panic and a confession of hide and seek in the babies room from my son we found  chaniqua  huddled under a fallen mattress. She s been there 3 days!!!!!! Luckily she said she slept well so kudos to you on quality. I was telling my journalist pal about your idiocy on my wall and she mentioned I should perhaps play you at your own game  so here goes.... You sent me 2 mattresses that didn t fit and a third that did for a bed I couldn t use for 4 weeks. I had to keep buying the mattresses for a bed I couldn t use because you won t refund until collection. Your collection courier wouldn t collect because a 27 week pregnant lady couldn t wrap the mattresses. You had me spend days chasing you and so far all responsibility has been placed on me despite your admission that it was incorrect web details on your site that caused this. Still no refund  still full of mattresses and still angry! So  I now start backdating you fees I have accumulated. 1) a packer usually makes £8.11 an hour accounting to JSPlus website. I ll pack the mattress regardless of my health and body shape but I ll invoice you an hours pay. To store items in a rental storage it costs £22.50 a week according to easy store. I ve been storing your stock now for 4 weeks and so that s a further £90 you owe me. You have kept my money for such time also and so I will also be charging interest as of tomorrow. Each correspondence according to my pal who is a solicitor would have cost me £35 had I not paid my Tesco card bill. So I shall also be working out how much I ll charge for emails and posts.  I appreciate that at times there s a jovial tone to my mail. This is due to the fact I am hormonal and fear for public safety if I don t stay calm. But don t misunderstand me  I am seriously  unstable and ragged with rage! I killed a wasp today T  and I enjoyed it! This is on you! A woman complains on your site about her little kids not getting free fruit as she shops and you re straight in there with an apology. I complain that you re withholding my money for items I didn t order  refusing to collect them unless I exert myself in pregnancy and yet NADA! Don t make me use my minority card (I m ginger) because you re pushing me to it  T! Did I also mention I m a stress eater? If this carries on I ll also be charging you for a whole new wardrobe as I m stuffing my face to cope! Yours  seriously peed off now  Mel of Burnley!					2016-09-19T14:15:51+0000	1474294551	2016-09-19 16:15:51	6	4	10	3	17	4	4	0	8	0	6	1	0	3	0	0	0

Baby bok choy would sell well loose (no need to pack) and is so quick  simple and tasty. Also our local Tesco  superstore  only gets boring frozen fruit and veg. e.g. All the food papers say that you sell frozen avocadoes and other interesting products  but someone at head office seems to have decided we are a bunch of chavs who exist on junk food and don t cook from scratch.					2016-09-19T14:15:41+0000	1474294541	2016-09-19 16:15:41	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I usually go on a Monday morning after coming back from the clinic but I can never get a trolley. I have been able to get transport on 2 Thursday s and was able to do some shopping  though one of the times the trolley ran out of power half way round and one of the staff pushed me back. Is it company policy that the stores can only have 2 mobility trolleys because it seems so. When I enquired when would it be repaired nobody seemed to know. I prefer shopping at the store rather than on-line. Could you find out if they are going to fix the other trolley.                                            Thanking You P Raven					2016-09-19T13:13:05+0000	1474290785	2016-09-19 15:13:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately I had a fall whilst I was there and have fractured my ankle. Your staff were fantastic  from trying to make me as comfortable as possible including one staff member offering her jacket to keep me warm  phoning for an ambulance  trying to keep my spirits up through the pain and most importantly helping comfort my upset children  wiping their tears and giving them a cuddle and a bit of reassurance. They were a credit to Tesco especially and I will definitely be attending future events once I m back on my feet  but will try to be a bit more careful next time!					2016-09-19T13:09:35+0000	1474290575	2016-09-19 15:09:35	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The sign on the door is for ladies toilets  baby changing and baby feeding.... I am disgusted that they think someone can feed a baby in there as there isn t so much as a seat on the toilet let alone a chair (not that anyone should have to feed their baby in the toilets anyway). I spoke to the manager there who seemed a bit dismissive and insisted that it was a generic sign and that bigger tescos have the space and they don t. However that is not the point as it is advertising you can feed there when there isn t the facilities! She almost suggested I close the lid of the toilet until I pointed out there wasn t even that and it would still be incredibly unhygienic! She said she would remove the sign but we will wait to see on that one. I will include the photo of the sign in a seperate post as it won t let me attach two here.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14369856_10154448774669484_8614157810742428707_n.jpg?oh=b7f8a5cf56f029e2640714b33433d3dc&oe=58F00D22	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14369856_10154448774669484_8614157810742428707_n.jpg?oh=a8ab21e2a439a4a86cb0d6678ed7f2cd&oe=59187D2F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154448774669484&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-19T12:45:56+0000	1474289156	2016-09-19 14:45:56	0	12	11	0	23	11	2	9	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	9	0

This weekend however my husband took me away Friday night so I booked my delivery for Sunday AM instead of my usual Saturday AM (or so I thought I had). We arrived home roughly about 6pm Saturday only to have the police knock at the door 5 minutes later. I had only booked my delivery for Saturday AM by mistake and the driver had tried to deliver to me 3 times without success. As I am always there to welcome them  they found it out of character and phoned the police as they were concerned for my welfare! I didn t really pay any attention to my phone the whole weekend and completely missed the reminder text and my phone was off most off Saturday so missed the phone calls from the Store and the Police! So I charged my phone straight away so I could call Tesco and within minutes of me turning my phone on the Store rang me  checking I was OK and letting me know that my delivery is fine and they would just deliver to me tomorrow instead. Then 5 minutes later the store called me again and said that someone was on their way and would be with me within the next half hour! Considering the mess up was completely my fault  they couldn t have been any more friendly and helpful. Tesco customer service is apparently second to none! 10/10! Unfortunately  with all the commotion  I missed the lady s name that I spoke to on the phone and the chap s name that delivered my shopping so I am unable to thank them personally but Tesco - Thank you for caring. I ll be shopping with you forever!					2016-09-19T11:56:24+0000	1474286184	2016-09-19 13:56:24	5	1	7	0	8	1	1	0	1	0	5	2	0	0	0	0	0

Today I picked up good quality rasps as well as some lovely aronia berries - wish you had them in quantities to make jam. I also got those miniature kiwi fruit. There s certainly an interesting range of stuff to keep me on the straight and narrow and I am now nearly 2 stone lighter. Pity about all that plastic packaging - good old fashioned cardboard would be so much lighter and cheaper. I also enjoy the interesting new grape types  especially the strawberry miniature grapes and the  tropical  ones.					2016-09-19T11:38:38+0000	1474285118	2016-09-19 13:38:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I got a call at 11.30 to say there was a problem with payment so the order had been returned to store. The man I spoke to retook payment over the phone and said he d get the order redelivered later that day. I explained we needed it by 1.30  so he drove it over himself straight away. I am very impressed with the service and would like to thank Ricky (I think) from Harlow for making sure we had the food on time. The food was also very good (except the sticky chicken sticks!) thank you!					2016-09-19T10:40:36+0000	1474281636	2016-09-19 12:40:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This Hudl 2 project has been a disaster for them and their customer service with it is abysmal.  My hudl is now of for its 2nd repair.  1st it was refusing to charge and freezing.  Now 3 days before the warranty expires its battery is sticking at 100% and freezing again. The only solution is send it back for a repair.  I want a refund on this useless tablet.  It s been plagued with faults from day one.  I spend £1300 a year with tesco  or should I say I DID spend that with tesco.  I will spend not a penny more with you.					2016-09-19T10:37:04+0000	1474281424	2016-09-19 12:37:04	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This hair was tightly packed inside the ham / bread and made me feel physically sick when I discovered it would around my tongue. Clearly your staff are not sticking to the health and hygiene rules and keeping their hair covered.  The sandwich was a Just Ham one  best before date of 18th September and was bought in the Feltham  Middlesex store on Friday 16th September.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14370291_10157460576070635_9077498578003707915_n.jpg?oh=81376794346acbbdcc6b77ed0475f82a&oe=58DB4334	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14370291_10157460576070635_9077498578003707915_n.jpg?oh=b68057bb67f903075e6571e4e6acc9ef&oe=58D68340	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157460576070635&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-18T22:16:22+0000	1474236982	2016-09-19 00:16:22	1	4	1	0	5	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am disgusted that this is the  fresh  produce you are selling!  Quite often the produce that is on the shelf has a day left before its shown expiry date.  My partner and I feel that you are letting your customers down  we chose to travel the extra distance to your store despite there being a morrisons closer to us as we find tesco a nicer place to shop and can easily find everything we need. However  we are now strongly considering shopping elsewhere.

Every week i shop at tesco... this week my dad decided to do my an order online due to financial problems i have had this week... so it was meant to be here between 12-1 pm... it got to 3pm so i decided to ring... lovely polite woman answered... was really helpful and told me thag delivery was delayed due to lack of staff.. i said not a problem as long as it will be here today... she said she would ring me back... she didnt which is fine cause 4pm came and i rang back again. .. got told it would definately be here today.... so 6pm came around baring in mind... i have two young children no food in my house at all not sufficent enougj for tea anyways... so my partner had to run to the shop to get there tea .... more money wasted as if the shop that we ordered had of arrived we wouldnt of had to spend money that to be honest we couldnt afford to.spend ... but anyways so they had there tea put them.to.bed... half 7 came... my sister rang them.at this point. .. oh it was a failed delivery... no it wasnt i have been sat in ALL DAY unable to take my kids out on a lovley day out on a sunday which i had planned ... so i had.to.let them down... as i was sat waiting all day for my food shop that then has been told it wont arrive till tomorrow.... between 11 and 12... so tesco i ask you this what are my kids meant to have for breakfast  .... so now ive.had to trail to the shop late at night to get myself some.tea and somestuff in for breakfast soo pleassee tell me why is this acceptable.? I always praise tesco its my favourite store... but today has really infuriated me... the lack of communication between your staff and your customers i shouldnt have to ring 4 times in total today.

Following an incident that could have seriously injured my child today at this place  I have contacted the community police team and schools in the area regarding these children. They are using Tesco Ingleby Barwick as a socialising area with total disregard of how their stupid action today could have injured my child  and they may intimidate other potential customers.  It is not the first time I have encountered problems at this store regarding children hanging around  do you have no security or CCTV to ensure they are not there causing problems? I do believe tesco own the surrounding land  so whose responsibility is it to ensure customers feel safe when they shop?					2016-09-18T19:35:33+0000	1474227333	2016-09-18 21:35:33	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

For the past 9 WEEKS your Goole SUPERSTORE has not sold Aubergines. I have spoken to staff and management and been told they will be back in stock - NO. I have tweeted 3 times and was told twice to drive 15 miles to the Selby store which for some reason has them in stock. Can someone please tell me WHY they are out of stock and WHEN they will be back in. I know goole is rather working class but  we live 5 miles away in Howden and like the purple vegetable. Many thanks and lets hope we can stay together. xxx					2016-09-18T19:32:51+0000	1474227171	2016-09-18 21:32:51	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One happened to be our spring onions. Having a look at what we got  we couldn t understand why they said they had no large spring onions yet delivered us all 5 alongside their  substitute  which was 12 packs of small spring onions.   We now have a field full of onions in the bottom of our fridge and are unsure what to do. Driver had no idea why all the spring onions  and it was too late to let him take them back as the large ones weren t on the receipt as proper item just substitution.   Next time Tesco please just bring us what we asked for and not more than that :L					2016-09-18T19:05:09+0000	1474225509	2016-09-18 21:05:09	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I spend quite a bit there  but lately I can t buy regular items because they are completely out of stock. Today  when I suggested they sorted their stock ordering process. I was told it was head office who did the ordering based on sales. Well I can t buy something if you haven t got it!! Look at these empty shelves and explain why if I can t buy a regular shopping list  I shouldn t change allegiance and go elsewhere. I have more photos of other similar shelves elsewhere in the store.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14322779_10154077841485326_3307678089639955299_n.jpg?oh=eacac42ec72b70969454902d41f829dc&oe=58E9B32D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14322779_10154077841485326_3307678089639955299_n.jpg?oh=ffe119d694bd8b4d231eda85a44a698b&oe=58DF1320	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154077841485326&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-18T18:00:21+0000	1474221621	2016-09-18 20:00:21	7	8	7	0	15	8	5	3	7	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just bought a fresh broccoli from your Teignmouth metro store and there was 3 caterpillars inside!!   It is safe to say that we did not eat it as they were still alive and I m not all that impressed by this discovery.

Today I went shopping with my baby and 4 year old in tow alone  which is stressful enough as it is but for good measure my 3 month old decided she wanted to be carried as we were nearing the end of our shop. We headed straight for the till where i started one handed loading all my items onto the belt and my 4 year old nearly had a breakdown because we forgot the cake mix 😣 Brian sensed the stress and impending breakdown from said 4 year old and asked someone to grab it for me 👍. With that Sally and Sarah came over took over the unloading and packing from me and Sarah even helped me to the car loaded it in the boot and put the trolley away. They were all amazing and a great credit to Tesco 😇 from now on Tesco Mayflower will always be my first choice.  Thankyou from one very greatful mummy 😀					2016-09-18T16:24:50+0000	1474215890	2016-09-18 18:24:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s been a hard few days and she is doing so well considering the ordeal she has been threw. We have just done our first shop of pretty much any diabetic foods  sugar free goodies  carb counting every item that went in the trolley and not forgetting those jelly babies ready incase of a hypo. :(  We arrive at the till and it s quite clear what our shop consisted of. Maybe as new parents to this we went a tad over board.   The check out staff (Keith) who we have seen many times in tesco turns out is also diabetic! And he showed his name badge to my little girl which said he was diabetic ! My daughter gave a massive grin as if reassured she isn t the only one!   My husband and I had no idea that tesco charity is Diabetes UK! 😃  We have almost finished packing our shop and we had a hand full of tesco staff around us  with one of the ladies holding this my little pony! Saying how brave she has been and gifted it too her! 😍 Well her little face and the smile my daughter had 😀. My husband and I can t thank tesco Martins Heron enough for being so lovely!

She displayed some strange behaviour trying to stare at my eyeballs which made me feel quite uncomfortable. It took me longer to pack my bags as she kept distracting me by chatting about how her chipped nail varnish was irritating her. It didn’t take me long to figure out what was going on. Especially when I observed the slapdash way she gave me my change  checking it only once. She wasn’t autistic like me  she was neurotypical. She must have been a high functioning neurotypical seeing as she had a job. Tesco make me proud offering these opportunities to neurotypical people. Neurotypicals deserve an equal chance in life and employers like Tesco help them by providing it. Who knows how her life would have turned out if Tesco hadn’t given her a chance? I have neurotypical people in my family and Tesco have given me hope for their future. Thank you Tesco.					2016-09-18T14:30:09+0000	1474209009	2016-09-18 16:30:09	64	9	88	14	111	8	6	2	53	0	62	3	0	19	1	0	0

I have anxieties and had a panic attack  it took about half an hour to drive to the tesco  and i still felt on the verge of tears upon arrival. I had my children in tow  my 3 year old son who causes trouble whenever he can like any other child  and my 8 year old daughter who is autistic. I asked at customer services if someone could help us with our shop today as I had no carer with us and we d just had a horrible experience elsewhere. They were amazing! Our list wasn t a long one  and Sam was very patient as we perused DVDs and books and bits that weren t listed. She got the kids involved with choosing things and helping  and when the children had had enough the rest was found quickly. She opened a new till so there was no queueing to pay  and found us someone to help us to our car who was also an absolute star.  We have just reached home and my eyes are once again on the verge of tears  but this time ones of gratitude. Those lovely women deserve something extra special  they absolutely saved our Sunday 🙂  Thankyou so so much for all the help and support!					2016-09-18T13:10:41+0000	1474204241	2016-09-18 15:10:41	9	0	9	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	9	0	0	0	0	0	0

In a 15 minute window I witnessed three cars park in parent and child bays without any children in the cars. I saw a further three cars which looked highly unlikely they fell into the bracket of possibly transporting a child under the age of 5. Having complained to a member of staff at your Barkingside store  she actually acknowledged they have received multiple complaints of this nature; not just from parents but users of disabled bays who have witnessed cars without the blue badge parking there too.   Since some supermarket chains have started enforcing this there really is no excuse. I don t think there is any occasion where I haven t witnessed abuse of this bays when visiting your store  so this really is quite a lucrative opportunity for you  and you ll please quite a large group of your customers at the same time.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14358642_10100164922294025_4747262223646221517_n.jpg?oh=1b2ef660f2fe8b93bdec1104ff754967&oe=58ED3C4B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14358642_10100164922294025_4747262223646221517_n.jpg?oh=fc66558de04215baf8c93bae491fe5f5&oe=58EB673F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100164922294025&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-18T12:07:48+0000	1474200468	2016-09-18 14:07:48	2	10	2	0	12	10	3	7	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Can I say that the Coopers field in City Centre  Cardiff is holding a pyjama party picnic today where literally thousands will be attending and the eyes of the world will be watching in. Surely if the world don t have a problem with people wearing pyjamas in public then surely you shouldn t and therefore  you should allow people who unfortunately have no clothes and subsequently need to wear their pyjamas and fake ugg boots in your stores whilst they shop. I look forward to your response.

Having tried to order my usual soya decaf latte in the cafe Iwas told it was not possible to make it as they had been given instructions to only use Tesco Soya milk which will not blend with the decaf coffee. As I cannot drink ordinary milk I could not have a drink.  So in order to save 20p (retail) on a carton of soya milk Tesco are now losing £2.50 per drink not to mention that the customer has to go without the drink!  Can someone please sort this out as it does not make sense to turn custom away for the sake of 20p.					2016-09-18T06:15:40+0000	1474179340	2016-09-18 08:15:40	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I holidayed in Stalham in Norfolk and the service l received was remarkable. The staff were helpful courteous an always pleasant. It won me over to shop again. Yet when visiting Tesco in Brixham l was made to feel an inconvenience. Gone was the smile. I was expected to  fetch   the alternative l required and had to ask which aisle!! No smile no real eye contact no feeling of friendliness .Nothing like the the advert!!! It was even too much trouble to accept the bag of coins l had found on the shop floor. First l was told just take it to the till. The till operator took it and put it behind her on a shelf. No thankyou no request for my details. A curt someone might come back. Is it not policy if an item is found and unclaimed it should be returned to the finder? Would be interested in it s fate. Lost faith in Tesco.

On every occasion we have left empty handed with a very sad little boy to deal with. You see  he always finds the toy he wants (wwe figures) but everytime we take it to the check out it gets taken away as there is no record of it on your system!! Why is this? Why do you continue to have them on the self if they can t be sold?  On these 3 occasions  we  have left the store without much of an explanation other than  sorry you can t have it!   However today was different. My sister took my son in to purchase a figure as a gift whilst I stayed in the car with my sleeping baby. 10 minutes later they returned to the car empty handed once again and my son was extremely upset. The man at the customer service desk had told them there was no record of it therefor it could not be sold. When my sister questioned why it was on the self with a security sticker on he said that it shouldn t be there.  I returned straight away with my son seeking a better explanation and we witnessed the same man returning the toy to the self. Once again we picked it up and went back to the check out only to be told we could not purchase it. After refusing to leave without it a very helpful man called Nathan who works there was able to find a barcode on his phone and sell us the toy. WHY DON T ALL THE STAFF KNOW HOW TO DO THIS!! Do you have a better explanation as to why this happens every time?  #thankgoodnessfornathan					2016-09-17T19:19:36+0000	1474139976	2016-09-17 21:19:36	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now  you might assume my puppy is vicious and immediately set about amputating the poor little bunny that we purchased for him.   However  does this face look vicious? Does he look guilty of manhandling his new toy? Just look at him  he s far too cute to even kill a Daddy Long Legs  let alone a lifeless bunny toy.   It may have only been £5 but I would have thought his gift be more robust than to be amputated five minutes in to playtime.   Barkley feels incredibly guilty that he now has a one legged friend and wishes for you to strengthen your toys to ensure that no other Puppy feels such guilt at performing such unplanned surgery.   Please make your dog toys last more than five minutes    Many Thanks    Barkley  aged 1 year and 3 months old 💙🐾	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14322185_10157591486335195_6808588244562795417_n.jpg?oh=09b75bcec4264e16b8225c5137fd0e79&oe=58E6E4CF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14322185_10157591486335195_6808588244562795417_n.jpg?oh=51598565162d40bd5f425db5f129cf1a&oe=58ED9BC2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157591486335195&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-17T17:44:29+0000	1474134269	2016-09-17 19:44:29	54	29	78	0	107	27	11	16	21	0	53	7	0	13	4	0	0

I bought your Fig and Wensleydale salad with Balsamic drizzle.  I love figs and I love cheese.   Shame really as the were 3 half slices of Fig and a few light shreds of cheese.  Lots of melon  apple and pear and loads of Balsamic.   Reading the list of ingredients on the base of the pack it does list all these ingredients but the main packaging doesn t.   Very misleading and a complete waste of £4. I bought 2 packs because it sounded so good.   I can t even eat the cheese as it is now drowning in the Balsamic Drizzle which is lurking at the bottom of the bowl under the 4 remaining chunks of melon that I really don t like.   I thought that when you described items you had to use the item that made up the major part of the dish first.  I wouldn t have bought a melon and Balsamic drizzle salad.

We had been really wanting some for days. So I made the pretty long journey after the need became too great today to find - for the fourth time in a row - there were none left! 😨 there weren t even any strawberry flavour ones left which are our back-up grapes of choice.  The only ones left were the tropical flavour  which happened to not even taste remotely tropical.  Our hopes have been crushed and we are extremely sad 😢 I hope you can rectify this issue as Mummy is grumpy at her lack of Candy Floss grapes and Willow will not eat any others 😮					2016-09-17T17:10:54+0000	1474132254	2016-09-17 19:10:54	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Everytime i go in they have all the aisles blocked with cages. The staff are just down right rude. They can see you trying to get through and they just look at you gone out and carry on restocking. Wouldn t be so bad if they offered to move them or moved them forward a few feet so they weren t blocking the aisle. They have 5 aisles. The first was blocked top and bottom  went up the 2nd one that was clear  the 3rd was blocked  people were queuing up the 4th. Nearly 5pm on a saturday so wasn t exactly quiet either.

I understand that I was a bit mixed up and got my times wrong  I arrived at the store at about 3.55pm  thinking it was open until 5pm. I parked in a parent & child bay on the underground car park and could see a security guard by the door (please bear in mind how close these spaces are to the door)  I then proceeded to take my 13 month old little boy out of his car seat and carry him (along with my empty shopping bags and baby change bag ect) to the trolley bay. I placed my boy I  the child seat and could see the security guard looking over. He watched me spend a fair few minutes adjusting the straps on the seat so that my baby was secure  I then pushed him over towards the entrance so that I could do my shopping  only to be told by the same security guard that the store was now closed and I couldn t come in! I said I thought it was 5pm and he said no it was 4pm  so I asked him why he didn t tell me this before instead of watching me struggle and spend ages securing my boy to the trolley? His reply was that he didn t know if I was coming into store or not! If I had parked there and was strapping him into the trolley  was it not blatantly obvious? I was not impressed! I think anyone with any common sense would have at least shouted over to me and not let me carry on!					2016-09-17T15:08:40+0000	1474124920	2016-09-17 17:08:40	2	5	2	0	7	5	4	1	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Someone spoke to me yesterday just before 5pm and they told me the box for my insurance will be fitted between 9am-12pm then got a text saying it would be the afternoon. Phoned them this morning to say why have I been given two different times and they said to call if the person isn t here between half 1-2 but really the afternoon appointment is between 12:00pm and 4:00pm. I have at around 2pm called they have now said it would be within the next two hours and that I would get a phone call 30 minutes before the person was due to arrive. At 15:49 and the fitter has just got here. There was no 30 minute notice phone call. But not within the 9:00am-12:00pm time slot that i was originally told by the customer service!  I have now wasted my day thanks to the rubbish customer service that has been provided by you and I personally find this unacceptable.					2016-09-17T15:07:06+0000	1474124826	2016-09-17 17:07:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have spent 30 minutes on the phone to your  help centre  to try and purchase a television from you as my local store can not do this. After trying to buy on line and registered is was told I was already registered so submitted an forgot password request..got sent an email the postcode didn t work??? Rang the call centre got told to try entering Tesco@ and two numbers of choice.. didn t work as saying my postcode didn t match then rang again gave all my details and was told i have an account but was only asked my name number and first line off address which I gave from being born (which is four btw!) and was told that the account was set up in 2007 and again reiterated the 1st line of address (should know bought it in 2003 until 2013!) Was told it was wrong. Asked if was the same town i had mentioned and was told to email for a freedom of information and pay £10 which i explained i know the Data Protection Act and as I work in a call centre and questioned if i had had club card account then the details have been registered wrong  i was told that could not happen so asked to speak to a manager but the call handler started to give me the freedom of info request email address i stopped him and asked for the call to be escalated to it was the person immediately asked for my post code and confirm my name and the address in lived in 2007. Again after explaining that all i was trying to do was buy a telly from you again the call got transferred...which again i had to go all the information again through security questions and then told i did have an account never used and had no points but they could only put the purchase through as anonymous but to have make sure i have someone over 18 with me (i am 33 btw). Finally i purchased the tv however not got a next day delivery as promised on your website. This is true shocking customer services and will no doubt cost me a fortune on my mobile just to buy a product from Tesco					2016-09-17T14:50:18+0000	1474123818	2016-09-17 16:50:18	1	3	1	0	4	3	1	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Was encouraged to add our clubcard number to the quote  your customer service man said it was for further discounts. The resulting quote was £200 more than it was without the clubcard number on. This was proven when he took the clubcard number out again & the quote went back down by £200. Even your representative had no answer for this & apologised.

However as you can see  it doesn t state that on the website. It states the text will be sent in the morning. That is why I was so confused that we didn t receive a text until 3pm AFTER we had contacted customer services to ask when our order would arrive. In the voice message today  we were also told the late delivery will need to be reported back to the store  but I m not sure if she meant she will do it  or whether we need to contact Tesco again  or our local store.  Normally everytime we ve had a problem we have experienced really good customer service. But this time it has been totally different.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14370415_10154548213917884_8397540780269878302_n.jpg?oh=477994919bc7b570c8111e2cbdc65cc8&oe=58E93F0A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14370415_10154548213917884_8397540780269878302_n.jpg?oh=ea93c5f36195fa7dd2631cdf96f53379&oe=58E76707	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154548213917884&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-17T13:11:28+0000	1474117888	2016-09-17 15:11:28	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Had to throw it away and therefore it ruined the chicken curry Jess was due to make. Can you provide a gesture to apologize for this incident and the monies lost in purchasing gone off chicken?

I have 23 x £10 gift card vouchers and was trying to use them as past payment of this laptop. It took me 40 mins the first time and as there was a balance left to pay  I was trying to use my debit card. It wouldn t go through so i called the Tesco direct and got a very rude man  eventually he told me to try a different browser an have another go. If it didn t work  then call back. I tried again (another 40 mins) and it still didn t work. I phoned back spoke to another unhelpful man who said i could order over the phone. He put me in touch with another person  for me to be told  that as it was coming from one of  your partners   then I couldn t use the vouchers!!!! How disgusting - nothing in the payment section says that!! The other unhelpful people didn t tell me that!!! I assume as i am buying from  Tesco Direct   the cards should be valid. Never again will i attempt to buy from you!!! You are a total waste of my time					2016-09-17T10:13:57+0000	1474107237	2016-09-17 12:13:57	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve been a loyal customer for many years and have always had great service with excellent reliability. But this week you ve ruined it all. I ordered a dyson Hoover last weekend. Started with an issue with your computer that wouldn t accept my vouchers on line. After 4 hours over two days and talking to 3 different staff members it finally got sorted and was guaranteed it would be at my nominated store on Monday. NO - Tuesday No - Wednesday No - Thursday No - definitely be with you Friday you guessed it No!!!! I ve spoken to 3 more members of customer service. 2 member of staff at the store have also spoken to people. With no sign of my Hoover. The issue on Monday was yodel couldn t find the store as the postcode didn t match. It baffles me that you don t know the address of one of your own stores!  It s now sat in a warehouse in Bristol probably getting battered and bashed.  You have my money I just want the Hoover I ordered. The only thing I d say is the staff you have  have been lovely but that doesn t give me my order which you actually say will be with you the next day if ordered by 5pm. So how is it its now a week!!! Come on tesco sort it out.					2016-09-17T08:21:14+0000	1474100474	2016-09-17 10:21:14	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just tell them to be more careful when talking about or making faces about customers. You never know who is watching. I have removed the names.  Treating myself to a cuppa in Tesco  watching the staff and wondering how much customer service training one has had!!   Some of the people in that Tesco cafe need to learn customer service  especially the one in black with the scarf round her neck. If you are going to make faces to other staff members about a customer  at least wait till the customer is out of the way. I felt for that poor woman.  So rude!!! No need for it!   Tesco Maybe the look was given because the Downs girl dropped her toast. That table was enjoying themselves and probably had more manners in all of them put together than the bossy boots in black had in her little finger.

I was searching for sun tan loatin only to be told they had all been packed a way for winter. A lovely lady called Tracey went out the back and searched for one for me and brought me out two options. She went out of her way to help me. So thank you very much Tracey from Wolverton tesco :)					2016-09-17T06:59:39+0000	1474095579	2016-09-17 08:59:39	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When exited the store  i had very bad smell on your chicken rib  especially when i put it in my car. Arrived at home  and i opened the packaging  the chicken rib gave very bad smell and on that time i had thrown up. Then i throw it on the thrash.What very dissapointed me was  the chicken rib looks good outside but when i open it inside  the chicken hat turn black and bad smell.  So  hopefully i get your attention as soon as possible before i report this to KPDNKK   PPIM and any related Consumer Association.					2016-09-17T04:11:57+0000	1474085517	2016-09-17 06:11:57	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I needed milk and deodorant  plus I wanted to purchase a new Xbox one game.  As a disabled customer usually in a wheel chair I like to go late at night  when it is not busy  therefore it s easier to get around  with hardly any people there to have to weave in and out of. Tonight looked very dead. so I thought I would try my crutches. HUGE MISTAKE. I got my milk and deodorant picked up my game and headed for the checkout. I was knackered walking that far  but with my condition it is a real feat but I have to try.  At the check out I was told that I could purchase the milk and roll on but for the game I had to get it at customer services. Not very happy that had to walk more i started my journey  as I got there the check out runner said  you will have to go to music and video department desk for that  I have just called him. (This is the other end of the store!!!) I asked if I had to.  yes  I was told. And with that they left me. So off I went. Got there with a real struggle. I was in a lot of pain and now not happy to be back where I started  knowing I was going to have to walk all the way back. I wished I had got my wheelchair out the back of the car now. No where to sit I stood waiting in pain. Still unable to purchase the game I wanted. No one came. A few minutes passed so I pressed the bell for assistance. Nothing!! No one!! I pressed again every minute or so. I really wanted my game. Before my accident I was a very sporty person and loved playing football and basket ball now I can t so Xbox is as near as I get.  15 minutes passed and no one came!!!! I couldn t stand any longer. It s propably the longest I have stood in months. So I left the game box there and left the store!!  I am appalled that no one once offered me any help  that I was made to walk back and forth for absolutely nothing. I have really hurt myself in the process and I still have no game!!  I think this is a disgusting way to treat any customer let alone a disabled customer.   Think you need to change your company tag line from  every little helps  to  VERY LIITLE HELP    Will not be spending my money with you in future.					2016-09-16T22:34:38+0000	1474065278	2016-09-17 00:34:38	1	7	3	0	10	7	4	3	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	0

Yesterday my husband bought a bouquet of flowers for my birthday today (well done him!). Only for half the lily buds to fall off and today the gerberas are wilting .......and........after another visit to store to exchange a dress bought for the 2 yr old in our house (dress is beautiful but long sleeves are cut on the thin side so are very tight on the arms) I bought these tops instead.  They too are lovely  but you will notice that the price tag says £6 yet I was charged £7...something amiss there.

When he got home and tried it out he found it to be very poor quality and it s job. He has just driven the 10 miles back to the store to get a refund to then hopefully purchase a better razor while there however  when he got there the customer services desk was closed which is fair enough but he was then pointed in the direction of a manager by security and the service he received was not acceptable. He explained the issue with the razor to which the manager said well you ve used it  chucked it back in the bag and told him to come back tomorrow.   Firstly of course he s used it  he wouldn t of known it doesn t work if he hadn t tested it out. Secondly he s just just travelled half way across York to get it sorted the same day so would of liked a bit of time and respect. Thirdly I m sure any manager in store is capable of sorting a refund or exchange regardless of whether they work in customer services or not  every person who works in Tesco has a till log on.  My husband could tell the thin manager with glasses who dealt with him was not interested and so fobbed him off which in my eyes is bad customer service. This may seem petty over £12 but its more on the principle of him having travelled all that way to have to come straight home.  I look forward to your reply...					2016-09-16T21:50:15+0000	1474062615	2016-09-16 23:50:15	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

No where does it say GRISTLE AND BONE!!! MY partner has chipped half his back upper right tooth off on eating one of these burgers only to find a large chunk of BONE in his beef burger. Trip to the emergency dentist tomorrow if they re open. The burger is LACED with solid prices of bone. Me  my partner and our 2.5yr old toddler were eating together- thank goodness it wasn t out toddler who lost half a tooth tonight. Completely lost all my faith in the tesco brand. Disgusting tesco. Not what any of us expected out of a burger. Nowhere online or on the packaging itself does it give any warnings or indications that this could even be a possibility. Absolutely fuming. Partners got a sore on his tongue already then the cost of whatever treatment the dentist can do to correct this!!

Just as he knocked the door out eight year old our daughter appeared with her French Horn. The driver noticed and said  would you like to give me a performance? Her face lit up and she tooted out a single note. He said  thank you that was really good . It absolutely made her day!  It was such a lovely an unexpected thing to do. Many thanks to the driver  who unfortunately I did catch his full name  but it began with the letter  Z . The store is Tesco Extra  Southampton Road  Salisbury. The van reference on the delivery note is 7T / 1114. Delivery slot 20.00 - 21.00 😀😀😀					2016-09-16T20:34:00+0000	1474058040	2016-09-16 22:34:00	2	2	2	0	4	2	1	1	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered a jacket potato after paying was then told there was at least a half hour wait (at 12.10) so ordered something else. My husbands ham and eggs turned up a bit later with two practically raw eggs on top of the ham. He took them back to the counter where the cashier could see what was wrong before he even told her. Fifteen minutes later they bought the food back  onlt to find that not only were the replacement eggs still undercooked  the raw part from the previous eggs was still on the meat where the first eggs had just been scraped off. The chips were also raw in the middle as the cashier confirmed when he returned the playe a second time.  He had gone off it by then and asked for a refund.  I would hope the staff have had training in serving raw eggs and meat but clearly not.					2016-09-16T20:11:51+0000	1474056711	2016-09-16 22:11:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Would this be something Tesco could do to keep competitive?.					2016-09-16T19:31:23+0000	1474054283	2016-09-16 21:31:23	0	2	0	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My mother in law fell outside your Tesco store on Saintfield  Road   Belfast . After being assisted by a school boy outside the store who helped her up and got her a chair the staff then took over. The staff members were called Anne Marie and Sarah. They brought her through to the staff kitchen   made her tea  supplied tissues and were so so kind and attentive until we arrived . They comforted her and my mother  -in-law is so touched by their attentiveness . It is so much appreciated by all her family . We would also love to find out who the young man was who helped her outside . I just want you know you should be very proud of your employees actions .					2016-09-16T18:27:27+0000	1474050447	2016-09-16 20:27:27	37	6	39	0	45	6	4	2	5	0	36	2	0	0	0	0	0

I was purchasing beer amongst other groceries. I tried to purchase some cans of Snakedog IPA  which I was very excited about when I seen them on sale. We had to wait a while at the checkout as they wouldn t scan after a couple of minutes another store assistant went to fetch a price. After another prolonged wait I was then advised these were not actually on sale yet despite the shelf being fully stocked. No replacement was offered either so I just had to leave after paying for what was actually on sale. Will certainly think twice before purchasing beer from any of your stores again					2016-09-16T18:22:36+0000	1474050156	2016-09-16 20:22:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered my shopping yesterday to come today between 2 and 3  I buy a home delivery every week and have done regularly for around 6 months and never had a problem.   Role around 3 and still no delivery? Maybe the driver is running late  half 3... no delivery  call up customer services and ask about the delivery  they can t get hold of the driver and will call me back. Get another call asking if my delivery has arrived yet  I reply no and the customer service guy doesn t  know what s happened to it. A couple of call backs later and it still hasn t arrived and they have no idea where my shopping is and offer to have it delivered  the next day. Now  normally this wouldn t have been a problem but I have a baby and not enough nappies to last the night and no food in the fridge. I can t wait till the next day. I ask for a refund and walk 20 minutes to get to my local tesco.  On arrival there a no nappies in his size so I have the get the size below because the size above is to big.   How can you just lose someone s  delivery? The whole ordeal has really put me off. I like the home deliveries because the shops are usually  to manic for me and I don t drive so big shops are easier for to do online.   I m  really disappointed  and don t understand how shopping can go missing. Hopefully the refund goes through quickly so I can get some shopping in.

To channel my inner Gordon Ramsey  I am horrified at this chicken. As you can see it is still extremely bloody which was off putting enough  but also there was a nice little surprise of an add on organ-esque mass which was messy and bloody too. If I had of wanted a surprise I would have bought a kinder egg! I am quite put off food at the moment as you can understand  but fortunately our resident medic did ease our minds slightly by confirming the chicken was indeed dead  and was not suffering.

She then told me where to find the different milks etc and found us a choc soya milkshake in cartons.. She really bigged up yhe situation and I scanned these and both my son and daughter wanted one so the lady even opened them for the kids while I was putting rest in my shopping bag..

Then got rid of all branded ones then brought yours back in different packaging and have the nerve to charge 1.50bfor them. No im not a fan of asda but had to go there yesterday as no tescis were around and was very shocked to see their ready meals are only 95p and they even sell the branded ones for a pound. Needless to say i bought some. Even your clubcard cant justify the price difference.					2016-09-16T16:14:10+0000	1474042450	2016-09-16 18:14:10	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We have never felt so embarrassed and humiliated in all our lives. We paid the cash and asked to see the manager a member of staff rang him and told him he was needed at desk as there had been an incident . He came took the card and went off to check . We were left standing there for over 35 mins when he eventually came back and apologised as they were genuine stamps . We asked for their names and told we were not leaving it at that as it was disgusting how we were treat we were expecting police to turn up .

I order my shopping online and have done for a few years now.  Usually I get a delivery once a week and often have the same few delivery drivers and must say how great they are.  I have three children - whilst pregnant with our third the drivers went above and beyond to help me by unpacking the shopping out the crates  even putting frozen stuff right next to the freezer for me etc.  When we had our newest addition  Ella the deliver drivers have been marvellous again and made a fuss of her and my oldest children.  I must say - the drivers are more like friends now.  So helpful and very friendly. Thank you so much. An extra thanks for the gorgeous little gift that has just arrived from Tesco for Ella (a little box containing wipes  a weaning spoon and food pouch)  Very happy xxx					2016-09-16T15:31:59+0000	1474039919	2016-09-16 17:31:59	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The very affable security guard asked us if we had purchased any fish  which we had; fresh north Atlantic salmon from the fish counter. He asked us to check it against the door scanner again and the salmon set it off. He said they had been having this problem with fish setting off the scanner. My friends were alarmed by this story and concerned that there is heavy metal contamination in the fish. Can your technical people offer any other explanation please?					2016-09-16T15:20:57+0000	1474039257	2016-09-16 17:20:57	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After much deliberation my mum settled on a motoE phone than was within her bubget  when talking to the assistant and telling him the one she wanted he quoted a much  higher price saying that the price on display was discontinued last week. I asked him why it was still displayed at that price and was told he was not allowed to take it off. I replied that it was false advertising saying a product was one price and selling it at another and at least a discontinued sticker should have been applied or one saying a price change on this product.. His answer was well they are out of stock anyway but we could still get it on amazon or maybe click and collect. I m  afraid you had two very unhappy customers who took their custom to another company who sells you the product at the price it is displayed at. I really query whether this practice is legal  or if it is  is it just a ploy to let the customer choose and then hit them with a higher price. In either case it is very misleading and makes me wonder what other phone price or misrepresented as this is not the first time I have known this happen.					2016-09-16T14:17:10+0000	1474035430	2016-09-16 16:17:10	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We ordered the trampoline in July  well in advance  for his 7th birthday in August. A number of items were not included in the delivery which resulted in a devastated little boy being unable to have his trampoline birthday party.  When I rang about this I was told  that s what you get for ordering delivery  and  do you think we have time to check every box   In the next delivery some items were still not present and this continues to pose a major health & safety risk as the springs remain uncovered.   I am shocked and genuinely saddened at this service because at the core of it is a little boy who was greatly excited by the prospect of his new trampoline only to have his hopes crushed.  I have rang and messaged your company and have got nowhere. So all I can do is now ask people to like and share this status in the hope our 7year old will finally had his trampoline complete.  Please folks like and share					2016-09-16T13:48:32+0000	1474033712	2016-09-16 15:48:32	31	22	36	56	114	19	14	5	2	0	30	0	3	0	2	0	0

I bought a Jemima Tub sofa online. The order was cancelled the next day. When I complained I was told the sofa was actually available so after waiting 5 days for a refund I bought it again. After waiting several weeks for delivery  I get a phone call to say that the order has been cancelled again and I ll have to wait another 6 days for a refund. I have now been without a sofa for almost a month. Unbeliveable.					2016-09-16T13:32:27+0000	1474032747	2016-09-16 15:32:27	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Couldn t find them and when I asked a manager he said they had been withdrawn because of lack of sales. Strange when for years they ve been on aisle ends used for impulse buying. I have since found out the real reason. Tesco have delayed paying their bills and the supplier has got fed up with them and stopped supplying Tesco. Shame on you Tesco for putting your profits ahead of customer choice. I did wonder why there was an alternative much larger pack of eccles cakes if it was down to lack of sales. The real reason is now obvious to me.					2016-09-16T11:52:54+0000	1474026774	2016-09-16 13:52:54	0	8	0	0	8	8	1	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

These free from instant noodles are great for me as a quick lunch looking after a toddler  however at £1.50 a go and a stay at home mum it s not something I could afford for lunch a few times a week! I ve searched high and low on the Internet for just the sachets as I was thinking I could buy the rice noodles and just do it myself in a cup but can t find any the sachets anywhere! How about selling the pots as they are and also selling the sachets separate? Will give the people on the go (at work etc) a good option and us people at home another!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14364891_10155224405302306_5771164033923467357_n.jpg?oh=14163845aef297ad3fd3e0cd7fd70b07&oe=5920F765	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14364891_10155224405302306_5771164033923467357_n.jpg?oh=bbf38f9aabbed106dbd527fd471da543&oe=58E46BC2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155224405302306&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-16T11:36:31+0000	1474025791	2016-09-16 13:36:31	3	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I managed to pay £5.50 for 1 pepper as the weigh machine thought I had bought 11  (probably my fault with the self weigh machine it was so slow to register that I pressed it again  I do scan and shop)  the white cabbage I bought for coleslaw has been partly frozen in the cool store and is soggy  and I ve just come to use the kettle descaler to find one of the sachets must have been damaged as it s leaked everywhere. All these things noticed once home. Last week the milk was sour. Can I get a refund on the peppers  there s no proof that I didn t actually buy all 11 peppers?!					2016-09-16T11:16:59+0000	1474024619	2016-09-16 13:16:59	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After mixing all of the ingredients and cooking my cake there was an awful smell coming from the freshly  baked cake!! It was rotten eggs!! The eggs were off even we though the use by date was 15th September 2016  I also  checked all the other eggs in the same box and they too were also off!! Good job I allowed myself some more time to cook another batch. As I m sure the recipient of the cake would not have  been too pleased if the wedding cake would not have been ready for their special day on time!!

I find this very very insulting    Also rather a deliberate attemp to remove the scottish banner from produce    The government is doing the same  just look at the report on   Uk whiskey ?? .......... No thats scotch whiskey.  So an update on your process of dessision making regarding the rebranding of scotland as UK . Has this been done with all  english  produced stock also ?  Please update us here in scotland and let us know if anymore scottish produce is to be rebranded as uk ?

After getting out from the car it was raining  I walked over to the covered areas for the Trolleys. Not a single parent Trolley was there  however several discarded ones lay about  all in the rain and all soaking through  I walked around the car park looking for a dry one  10kg child in one arm only to find more wet parent chairs. Eventually I took one of the sodden chairs into the store in hope that a member of staff would see me struggling  baby in one hand trolley in the other. But No. I had to get in the queue for the cigarette / customer services queue. Child still under my arm. I pointed out to the cashier that i needed something to dry the chair. he casually threw some blue towel onto the counter and carry on serving other people. So STILL holding my child under one arm i very slowly struggled to dry this trolley down myself by hand RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICES. I then proceeded to do my shop with a crying child while staff member after staff member pulled cages out in front of me my wet trolley and my now crying baby. Inconsiderate staff with oblivious managers is not how you should run a store. Completely horrendous experience. Thanks Tesco.

I have just been on your app to check that I havent made a mistake; and i am correct. Which now makes me wonder  what other items have i bought over the last 6 months that have been at a higher price than they should have been! I have recommended Tesco to many of my friends  and my parents and brother have all started using Tesco on my recommendation. I will be going back to Asda unless i recieve a satisfactory explanation.					2016-09-16T09:09:18+0000	1474016958	2016-09-16 11:09:18	1	18	2	1	21	18	13	5	4	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

During said ad Ruth is seen scanning an avocado.  I do not claim to be a technology expert but given that she is using a hand held barcode reader and no barcode is is visible I would assume that the said reader can now identify fruit.  My question is will this be rolled out to self service tills as well or is it just exclusive to the handheld scanners.  I have attached a picture to confirm this new technology in action.  I eagerly await your response.

My sister and I purchased the Large Fish  chips and peas and 2 drinks. When we got our meals we only got a small half of a fish each and couldn t even eat it as the batter was so overdone we couldn t even cut through it. The size of the half small slice of fish was a joke. And the peas where cold. Couldn t believe how bad it was. Also shouldn t be on board as large fish when you only get half a small fish. Will not be going back again. Diane.					2016-09-16T07:50:01+0000	1474012201	2016-09-16 09:50:01	1	9	1	0	10	9	7	2	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My shopping was scheduled for delivery last night between 8-9 by 9.30 no shopping had arrived without any call either. I phoned them and they said they would phone back which they never did  so I called them at 10.45pm and they still couldn t give me an answer as to where my shopping was. The person I spoke to then asked if I would like to reschedule for Friday with an 8-9am delivery which I can t have as I work so I cancelled my shop. I phoned to complain on Friday morning to be told they had no slots and I could have a £10 voucher  what a slap in the face. I WILL NOT SHOP THERE AGAIN  what a disgrace.					2016-09-16T06:55:59+0000	1474008959	2016-09-16 08:55:59	0	6	0	0	6	6	2	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Many people  like myself order online for convenience and I admit that i would genuinely donate to Foodbanks but lack the time to go to them to donate. As well as the  have you missed these offers etc  section right before you check out online  why not have a simple  like to donate an item? . People like myself can simply click on an item or 2 which can simply go into a collection of non perishables at the store ready to be picked up by the local foodbank on set days.

I notice that your chicken sourced from Thailand is very much cheaper than UK sourced chicken  that surprises me as the transport costs must be very high. Could this be because it s cheaply produced in factory farms where chicken welfare is non existent? Can you tell me if a vet is present during the slaughter process and if Tesco monitors the whole process from hatching to slaughter  if so can you please show evidence of this?   I notice that your British produced chicken meat is clearly labelled  a union flag is displayed prominently on the packaging and it seems you want your consumers to know that it is British.  Why do you not label the Thai chicken the same?  Is it because the public would be  put off ? After all dog and cat is consumed in Thailand  frequently the cats and dogs are boiled or skinned alive  this does make me wonder about how the chickens are slaughtered.  Please can you explain why you import chicken from Thailand  this can t do your carbon foot print much good.					2016-09-16T05:44:22+0000	1474004662	2016-09-16 07:44:22	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The store is 24 hours and some aisles are clearly closed because of store improvements but there are restocking carts everywhere and we were in an aisle for a good four minutes looking at products and then an employee tells us the aisle is closed (which we apologised for  having not realised because the store is 24 hours) and then we moved into the neighbouring aisle and we can hear her talking about us to her colleagues. This is unacceptable! And there was NO EVIDENCE that the aisle was in fact closed. The store is 24 hours so the products the store sells are 24 hours. Were it an issue of store improvement  as we saw in other aisles  not a problem - but her attitude was vile and not something you want associated with your company. Restocking an aisle happens all day  every day in every supermarket across the world and is not a reason to close an aisle or mock customers.					2016-09-16T00:31:59+0000	1473985919	2016-09-16 02:31:59	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Watching the latest episode of The Great British Bake Off  I saw the contestants were making Churros. I had never come across these marvels before but as you can imagine my interest had been piqued. Before the credits had even finished I whisked my girlfriend away on the long and treacherous journey to my local Tesco  who I naively assumed would sell these doughy bundles of joy. However  upon arriving at Tesco s  I was horrified to discover that there were none for sale.   After aimlessly wandering around for what seemed like hours  and several arguments with my girlfriend  we settled upon some profiteroles which I usually love but will from now on will be tainted with the disappointment and heartbreak of your lack of Churros.  So to answer my own question  yes you can miss you you have never had.					2016-09-15T21:07:21+0000	1473973641	2016-09-15 23:07:21	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Since I ve been diagnosed  if we fancy a fish and chip night  we buy the gluten free pollack fillets. For some reason we only had 1 left in the pack so I asked my husband if he would like a  normal  one.  He opted for the Birds Eye Gastro Pub Beer Battered Cod and his rating ..... The beer batter was nice but I d rather have had the pollack! The fish was thin and the crumb was poor. Well done Tesco for giving us a product that is as good  if not better  than the major brands					2016-09-15T20:11:06+0000	1473970266	2016-09-15 22:11:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

None of the fruit has ripened  it has just turned from rock hard to rotten mush without any in between or edible stage. Sainsbury s manage to supply fresh  ripe fruit which is edible immediately and doesn t go off as it begins to  ripen . Why can t you? Ripen at home is a nonsense  please offer fresh  ready fruit in your stores. I wasted my money on your horrible fruit as I ve only managed to eat one plum  which was a spongy  tasteless mush that I threw away after a couple of bites.					2016-09-15T19:53:53+0000	1473969233	2016-09-15 21:53:53	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Me and my girlfriend found ourselves on our own unexpected journey this evening.   We have been venturing into your store at least 3 times a week on a hunt for Jam Doughnuts  a quest that we had bestowed upon ourselves.  Every time we have reached the section of many splendor  we have found custard Doughnuts  Apple Doughnuts but no jam. It was more disappointing than the 2011 Green Lantern movie.  My dearest took an ever hopeful trip to our local store today in the hope that you finally have these magical  bakery goodness. Can you imagine the delight on her face when the glow of red packaging shun upon her.  She bought a pack immediately and raced home to devour the first a many sugary treat.   This is where our problem arises.  A custard doughnut had found its way into the jam packet. She discarded this minor fault  and delved into a second only to be greeted by the same horror. We were willing to forgive  surely this must be a simple mistake  she thought. But this wasn t a simple mistake  it was unforgivable. Similar to the time Anthony Horowitz s Stormbreaker was converted to the big screen  starring Jimmy Carr.  We re entered your store this evening to grab a second packet  and I was praying for your safety that you had redeemed yourself  like Alex Pettyfer had when he entered the world of Magic Mike.  Once we had finally reached our safe place we call home  I was delegated to Guinea Pig. I tasted the first one  the first mouthful. As I chewed  I slowly lost my faith in your store as I too could taste the dreaded custard.   We now have a sad household  which does noone any favours. Just ask Grumpy s six brothers.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14329905_10209326494432770_6752455449109930856_n.jpg?oh=a5ac66455d308a389ad5c3f0b5633845&oe=58E5546F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14329905_10209326494432770_6752455449109930856_n.jpg?oh=281c026d92f2a49f8cdb19d73c31dddc&oe=59230F62	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209326494432770&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-15T18:48:47+0000	1473965327	2016-09-15 20:48:47	59	15	72	4	91	14	14	0	35	0	59	5	0	8	0	0	0

We went in to buy our daughter s 1st mobile phone this morning for her birthday on Saturday and we were served by a lovely young lady called Judy (I think that was her name  apologies if not). She looked after us very well  she was very patient with us and had excellent knowledge of the products. She was on her own in the mobile part of the store and quite a lot of customers were waiting for her attention.  She remained calm  and acknowledged all customers that were waiting immediately and reassured them well  so they didn t feel ignored. She did all this whilst continuing to deal with us and didn t once rush us. She was engaging and genuine and an asset to your team.  Too many people are quick to criticise and slow to recognise so hopefully this will reach Judy to let her know she is doing a fab job X					2016-09-15T17:43:23+0000	1473961403	2016-09-15 19:43:23	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had to have a look and ask if this was dairy free because my niece is dairy free the person I spoke to said she didn t know if it was dairy free and that I should speak to someone else which I did. I asked is this milkshake dairy free because it is with the dairy free milk the other person said no it isn t  I replied why is it with the dairy free stuff if it isn t she replied with this!! Because there was a free space so we put it there I was gobsmacked at this reply. If I hadn t looked or asked about this my niece would have been very ill because this milkshake was put there because there was a FREE space. What would have happened if someone had just picked it up thinking it was dairy free because it was the dairy free shelve. I wasn t happy with the reply I got and the fact that the milkshake wasn t dairy free but it was put there with a disregard of health and who picked it up.

Hi there I bought a Dolce Gusto coffee machine from you in June via Tesco Direct and after using it this morning and it working fine  it now won t turn on. Do you know how angry I get when I am lacking in caffeine?  Hubby cannot work without caffeine either so no work  no money and we will all starve to death. Could you help please before this happens?					2016-09-15T15:34:50+0000	1473953690	2016-09-15 17:34:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Then you said I could get a taxi to a main store to exchange   but you arranged that at the wrong main store which I d said i couldn t get to. ..... And you ve said I can t have the complaint address until later...... And you can t process the exchange until later.....  Now your not answering my messages.....  All this and I ve explained my home educated daughter relies on this tablet and has now been without one for a week. And has been in tears all day as she can t understand why tesco are being so mean and won t send her a new tablet when we paid for one......  Tesco.....please sort this.....NOW.

Every week I take a client in for her shopping  she is 98 today and the staff are fabulous with her every week  offering a chair whilst I do her shopping. Today however   they presented her with beautiful roses and lillies and a box of chocolate and the manager and staff passed their happy returns on for her 98th birthday. Fantastic service and above and beyond! They deserve a big thank you!!! 🎂🎉🌸					2016-09-15T14:58:43+0000	1473951523	2016-09-15 16:58:43	4	3	5	0	8	3	2	1	1	0	4	1	0	0	0	0	0

First  I buy some strawberries.. which I wanted ALL day with my melted chocolate.The strawberries were from the  perfectly imperfect  range - however  I didn t expect them to be MOULDY?!  So  I tweeted you and you responded.. claiming you would like to sort it out and send me a gift card. However  nearly 3 months later  still nothing. & now no response to any tweets. (being blanked by Tesco has to be one of the highlights of my day)  THEN  I go to Tesco  yesterday  to buy some Soreen Malt loaf snack (which has butter on) to find that it went out of date 30th August!! that s over two weeks ago.   Now  thankfully  I checked the date on it before eating it. My issue here is that I bought this  from a box  and it still had quite a few in. Which means this box hasn t been checked or replaced since before the 30th August. So today  I drove back up to this shop  to see if it was still there.. surprise surprise... the box is still there FULL of out of date malt loaf (with butter!!) This seems to just be laziness from staff and clearly no checks are being made from managers!   Disgusting. I shop in Tesco  every day! I have sent off for a club card  three times! something must be wrong with my address because that s two things  adding up to five times something not being delivered to my address..   Sort it out TESCO!! Can t say Sainsbury s is any better. Bought flowers to brighten up my room  2 days ago. Dead already. Asda here I come..	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14291674_1081299721990175_5039989056110114113_n.jpg?oh=b49b7fbd25948ed1f700d1b0ec025493&oe=591E804E	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14291674_1081299721990175_5039989056110114113_n.jpg?oh=b3dabcb4398daab5affb35c134f95b54&oe=58DE3CF5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1081299721990175&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-15T14:21:16+0000	1473949276	2016-09-15 16:21:16	3	7	7	0	14	7	3	4	3	0	3	1	0	3	0	0	0

You have no idea the extent to which you have ruined my day.   I have to admit  I have strayed from Tesco in recent years. But you ve won me over with your new range of lunchtime salads and snacks. My faves are the feta cheese and almond  oriental wrap  and brisket beef flatbread.   After 3 hours of teaching teenagers  lunch was going to be the highlight of my day and I was looking forward to the same beefy delight that I experience last week. Imagine my disappointment when I opened my lunch to be confronted with this horror.   This is not a pulled beef brisket flatbread. This is not a flatbread with a meagre portion of beef. This is a flatbread which is completely devoid of beef. There is no beef. Zero. This has the same amount of beef as a vegan s Sunday lunch. (I promise I didn t just eat it all first).   In the end  I was hungry enough to consider going to the canteen for a school dinner  but decided I d rather go hungry. And I have another 2 hours of teaching to get through this afternoon.   How can we rectify this? What are you going to do to put the beef back in my flatbread? The meat in my meal? The brisket in my brunch?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14264003_10153854872836596_1004502681155987154_n.jpg?oh=08ac8d6f05ccf173ec5fe947c7b513a4&oe=58DB2376	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14264003_10153854872836596_1004502681155987154_n.jpg?oh=3523e6e5dfbbb8365a9e4830303bf49a&oe=59214B7B	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153854872836596&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-15T11:57:35+0000	1473940655	2016-09-15 13:57:35	2	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was expecting a delivery between 7 and 8pm on Saturday and it didn t arrive. We received no email  text message or email to notify us of the non-delivery. I rang and was told that the van driver hadn t turned up for work and we couldn t pick the order up ourselves because the van was backed up to the doors and nobody could access the shopping (do your vans only have one set of keys each??). It was then re-scheduled for the following day between 12 and 1pm and guess what? It didn t arrive  once again with no notification. Then we got a phone call saying that it was scheduled for 7-8pm that evening. At that point  I told the caller - a van driver - to cancel my order. I asked him if I could speak to the store manager and he said that he wasn t available. This was the Carmarthen store and we were on holiday. We d ordered our shopping to be delivered to our holiday rental because we ve had excellent service from Tesco back at home  but this was absolutely appalling. The first two days of our holiday were ruined by being messed around and still having to go and do our own shopping when we d planned a day out.   This complaint has to go further than a customer services operator  it needs to go to a manager and then further than that if there isn t a proper investigation. I have more details than given above  this is just a summary.					2016-09-15T09:29:12+0000	1473931752	2016-09-15 11:29:12	5	2	5	0	7	2	1	1	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I rely heavily on online orders as my son has leukaemia and I cannot take him around the shop to purchase my goods.  Several times now it has issues it for the wrong day resulting in me having to have a refund (not back in account straight away) and having to replace it and take another amount from my account.  This not only leaves me short of money for several days but also have to spend time sorting it out with customer service.  No apology has been given on the times I have called either.  Disgusted.  May go to another supermarkets app and see if I have better luck					2016-09-15T08:57:52+0000	1473929872	2016-09-15 10:57:52	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I got to the milk aisle I noticed the milk that was there had the 13th September on the bottles. Had to get a member of staff to bring me some from the back. And to take the out of date milk from the shelves. I feel it s bad enough having normal out of date milk but milk you give to a toddler. I think more action needs to be taken to monitor things for going out of date. I m lucky I checked the date on the bottle before hand otherwise I would of given my toddler the milk without a second thought.					2016-09-15T08:31:51+0000	1473928311	2016-09-15 10:31:51	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

THANK YOU TESCOS   **A PINT OF MILK TURNED IN TO A MELTDOWN**   I went shopping first thing today at my local Tesco with my three FIVE YEAR OLD children. Everything was going swimmingly  I did a shop whilst the children helped. That is of course until I got to the till.   Whilst the lady was scanning the shopping I asked the lady to check that the avengers titan figures that I was buying for my children weren t charged twice as they were on offer (BUY ONE GET ONE FREE) whilst she was doing this my children were waiting patiently to receive their newly chosen dolls. Unfortunately  (not to my surprise) the till was showing that they were not on offer.   The cashier called over a member of staff to go and get and check and a few minutes later she returned with the label which was underneath the figures showing quite clearly TITAN HERO AVENGERS BUY ONE GET ONE FREE £13 each (see photo)   The two staff then continued for a few minutes to scrutinize the label but they couldn t decide why it wasn t showing up at the till. A few minutes later one of the staff said that they would go and phone head office. The lady disappeared  whilst waiting for several minutes I explained to the lady on the till that I couldn t really wait as it wasn t fair on the children  especially if the lady returned and said no they were not on offer and it was mistake to put the label out. (YES THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE) a few minutes later the lady returned  saying she had passed this over to someone else to call the office (SURPRISE SURPRISE) ownership at its best!   (Meanwhile now my daughters were crying LOUDLY wanting their figures)   I made the decision to take a photo of the product and label and then explained to the lady on the till I would take this up online on that I was going to leave  thus handing back the original figure that had been scanned  to be refunded. (THE CHILDREN WERE INCONSOLABLE AT THIS POINT)   I then paid for the shopping and made a hasty exit before the children really erupted in their despair.  Facebook doesn t upload the photo to it s best resolution. However  the photo that I took saved as a JPG 2.12mb clearly shows the label.   Avengers Titan Hero 12inch figure £13 buy one get one free   *Side note on the till it scanned as TITAN HERO FIGURE £13.   I am not holding out hope of any assistance however  I promised my children that I would try. Meanwhile we search Amazon looking for a replacement.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14333590_10153634989771486_3795265734674495343_n.jpg?oh=2d11a47ca5ed7173125a49e950fda4db&oe=5924704C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14333590_10153634989771486_3795265734674495343_n.jpg?oh=c0eb367624d0761e56c694d4f81d57ed&oe=591B9941	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153634989771486&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-15T08:17:31+0000	1473927451	2016-09-15 10:17:31	2	2	2	0	4	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in your askham bar store yesterday evening getting a few bits and bobs. I m currently following the Slimming World healthy eating plan so was looking at foods I can fit in with that. Walking down your frozen food section I spot the display aid for  healthy foods  so take a walk down there. Well much to my dismay the display card is in the wrong place. The healthy food sign is situated next to ice creams and high fat ready meals oh and pies. Fortunately I was feeling strong yesterday so didn t faulter and buy any of these products but I was very disappointed that your merchandiser hadn t picked this up when moving products around. How many other shoppers in my position will have gone looking for the healthy food and thought  oh it s not here but I ll get a pie and follow it up with ice cream  I have tried to notify your customer service team but seem unable to get a response.					2016-09-15T08:14:52+0000	1473927292	2016-09-15 10:14:52	5	5	6	0	11	5	4	1	3	0	5	0	0	1	0	0	0

I went to your Milton  Cambridge store to pick up my prescription only to find out that last time I picked it up and asked them to re-order it they lost my slip and didn t order it. The pharmacist asked me if I had a card with a collection date on it  I don t because I always pick it up when i m running low. He then tried to excuse the mistake saying that they had 3 new members of staff atm. I don t think that s a good reason for my prescription slip to go AWOL. That s like saying that your care to your customers isn t important because you have new staff. The only staff member that seemed to care was a younger guy with dark hair and glasses. He checked you diary  he kept looking as I walked away  he remembered putting my slip in the re-order basket and confirmed that I had asked you to re-order it as the pharmacist seemed to want to blame me for their mistake.

Sorry  my mistake. I spent my morning running a weeks worth of shopping through a self serve till whilst  happy to help  Steve or whatever the lynx Africa smelling pre-pubescent boy was called watched me struggle and shout at the cocky self serve machine. I asked him if he could remove the tags from the toothbrush heads I had in my bagging area and he looked at me like I had told him Santa wasn t real.

I live in Bethnal Green and I shop at the Tesco Metro on Bethnal Green Road. My flat mates and I shop there for our groceries and basic domestic needs and we have recently discovered your Valle Central Merlot from Chile. I have to say that we will never drink another wine- we have taken it in as the mascot of our flat. Keep doing what you re doing Tesco- we love your wine!

I ordered a present for my sons birthday via click and collect and went to collect yesterday evening in preparation for his 7th Birthday which is today. On arrival at the Sheldon store I discovered it was closed as it had flooded due to the bad storm we had. There were no staff around to speak to and the doors were locked. After a few phonecalls my husband managed to get in touch with Gav from the store and explained the situation. He located my item and we now have one very happy boy! Sorry I don t have a surname for him but he was so nice and went out of his way to help us so I just wanted to let you know and to pass on our thanks to him.					2016-09-14T22:03:06+0000	1473890586	2016-09-15 00:03:06	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

What I found was the most horrendous thing EVER use have stopped stocking the 650ml bottles. My life has now been ruined I actually don t think I will be able to sleep tonight. Going to Tesco to get my despos was like telling your kids there going to the zoo that s how I felt. I feel there is a part of me now lost. Thanks Tesco hope you can live with yourself.					2016-09-14T21:46:50+0000	1473889610	2016-09-14 23:46:50	8	13	10	0	23	13	6	7	5	0	8	0	0	2	0	0	0

It was clearly leaking out from under there freezer as you can see in the video s... We complained to tesco about this as this could have easily been avoided had there of been wet foor signs there at the time but there was not....  There responce was to have an argumentative telephone call with me trying to tell me they had no way of knowing the water would be there and that a customer must have spilt it therefore making them not liable at all... however it was clear at the time it happened all the staff were aware of the water as they commented on it to each other saying how there should have been signs there etc etc and that they were there earlier on in the day but as they were closing somebody must have moved them or put them away... Anyway today i was just walking past so i went in to check if it had been sorted... I found out there had been another  apparant   costomer spillige  that day just before i walked in too... Instead of accepting responsibility and making a decent appology to us they called security had me thrown out for trying to collect said evidence then tried to have me arrested for doing so...  however i do have this clear evidence and i will be sharing it... this is my son 3 days ago... spot the wet floor sign !	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14333603_10153802031746437_1583366743010794593_n.jpg?oh=b2d4e1fc12e9abcaa91633e03b32fc8f&oe=5919BD09	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q81/s720x720/14333603_10153802031746437_1583366743010794593_n.jpg?oh=4fb5244e5bd4f4d6108a660cd834a0a6&oe=58E5C1FC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153802031746437&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-14T21:43:31+0000	1473889411	2016-09-14 23:43:31	1	11	2	9	22	11	6	5	6	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

I asked if the counter was shut and the gentleman replied with yes but if he could access what I needed he would me. Unfortunately he couldn t but he was so apologetic and possibly the nicest man I have ever met. Me and my partner usually go the counter and his customer service is always second to none....In fact I d say the best Iv ever received. Iv never walked away from somewhere without what I intended to get so happy. I didn t catch the guys name but he is around 50-60yrs old and a true gentleman. I truly believe he deserves recognition for his outstanding customer service every time I have been 😊😊					2016-09-14T19:56:30+0000	1473882990	2016-09-14 21:56:30	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

They re low cost and really easy. However tonight i bought this beef roast dinner frozen and cooked from frozen as instructed for 45 minutes in the oven. However i bit into something that almost broke my tooth. What seemed like a carrot under the gravy turned out to be some kind of 2 inch solid stick(not like a frozen vegetable) with some carrot skin surrounding it. Luckily i could spit it out but this would have choked a child. I m not an expert but i wouldnt expect that!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14264210_10157331926240447_4645663719230824666_n.jpg?oh=5d1ffa00c48574c86e06fc0cf7601ae0&oe=5921CAF8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14264210_10157331926240447_4645663719230824666_n.jpg?oh=828395e34e50fa6eaaf177c1a887f3ad&oe=58E567F5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157331926240447&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-14T19:43:18+0000	1473882198	2016-09-14 21:43:18	1	6	1	0	7	6	2	4	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every box I have bought has had a couple of flies in and are very slimey. I have bought from wakefield barnsley wales and hornsea while being away from home. Today I thought I d give them one last try and bought one more box. After opening them for my little boy I washed them and threw most of them away. Very slimey and look like they are going off. I got the ones with the best date as the other ones I noticed wer growing mould and fur on. Think strawberries will be off my list in future.					2016-09-14T19:27:27+0000	1473881247	2016-09-14 21:27:27	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

So........ i get an email saying socks arnt going to be sent to me  then another email saying the grey shorts arnt going to be sent to me - had an email to say the polo shirts and the trousers had been despatched! Ok fair enough i get it must be busy at this time of year. So then I get an email saying the polo shirts wont be delivered and an email from DPD saying the order with the trousers hasnt been recieved by them! Soooo you have my money and i have no school uniform and i dont know whether im getting the trousers or not.

My husband got a shirt he wanted and wanted a second one in a different colour. Eventually I managed to find it  listed separately from the first although the only difference was the colour.  I followed the checkout procedure only to find that I could collect the shirt tomorrow for a SURCHARGE of £2.  What s going on Tesco? This isn t fair.  I d go so far as to call it a rip-off.  I didn t order the second shirt.  I spoke to Eloise who was very helpful checking there wasn t another shirt in the store.  Incidentally  there was no-one on duty near the computer or the changing rooms.  Eloise was working elsewhere but was happy to help.					2016-09-14T17:04:28+0000	1473872668	2016-09-14 19:04:28	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s even more sad that Tesco have failed to act in helping me resolve this issue and that every time I m promised a  callback  they never actually materialise.   So the item that I ordered for my mums birthday last week is still missing; the money has been taken from bank and no offer to refund any part of the cost or the £6 delivery charge. This is the first and last time I will be ordering anything via Tesco Direct.

Does the grower and variety change?  I bought some a few weeks ago and they were delicious. I bought  more and the one bag are awful and the second bag although better is not as good as before.

I have a couple of questions for you if possible? Do you like yoghurt? Of course you do. I don t really know why I asked. Every sane person likes yoghurt. Perhaps not Turkish delight ones but hey  flavours are down to a slightly more personal preference.  Anyway  how about raspberries? They are a fine fruit. I m sure you like those too. I do. Well.... did. You see  Tesco fresh raspberries are indeed rather tasty  especially in a yoghurt.  However  when you are in the middle of work and you throw your freshly bought raspberries into your yoghurty goodness you don t really check for... well  mould! Who would. They are scrummy fresh raspberries right? Alas no. They are now just a yoghurt covered mess. And I m a mess. My desk is also a mess. Why? Well I tried to get some yoghurt off the raspberries to show you.  I kind of failed. Like you did. With raspberries.   Yours covered in yoghurt and mouldy raspberries.

Seriously Tesco? Nearly 5 months out of date! I m curious now as to how often your staff at the Beaumont Leys Store carry out stock checks on dates?  I would love to hear back from you as to what will be done regarding this  I assume you shall now carry out a deep training session with staff on how to check for these problems.

My cats will not go near the stuff. Their bowls are full of it and just stand and meow at me for different food. They eat other supermarket own brand cat biscuits  and aren t just being divas as they occasionally eat their own sick. I think your cat food needs to be sent back to the kitchen for further testing.

It s the pumpkin spiced Bailey s. Now some of my friends might argue that my love for pumpkin spice is an addiction. However after seeing it online to buy  I called Tesco up who told me that none of the shops in a 25 mile radius of where I live sell it. This also means that if I was to order it online it would most likely be replaced with a normal bottle of Bailey s  which really wasn t what I was after. Furthermore this realisation has left me huddled and shaking in a corner. Please do not put items up for sale that end up not being available  as for me I am looking for a pumpkin spice addicts group.					2016-09-14T12:38:39+0000	1473856719	2016-09-14 14:38:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just thought I would let you know about a little eggxtra I found in my Egg and salad cream filling. I was a little shell shocked to find it lurking in the tub and eggxtremely lucky I found it before it cracked my teeth. Accidents happen so just let your egg shellers know they need to be eggxtra careful next time.

I went to Customer services and politely asked if Tescos offer any kind of military discount. A large young lady there looked incredulously at me for asking in the first place and then with a rather unpleasant leer stated   no  we are not on that particular bandwagon .  I had no idea that serving your country was considerd by Tescos as  jumping on that band wagon.  I think if this is the type of   service  Tescos specialise in  anyone connected with the military should shop elsewhere.					2016-09-14T11:55:48+0000	1473854148	2016-09-14 13:55:48	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco sort your technical difficulties at the Enfield hub out!! As my refund on delivery charges & a £10 voucher off my next shop isn t worth the hassle! (I had to ask for those.)

My wife has coeliac disease and my children are gluten intollerent and allergic to dairy so this range is essential to us. When raised with staff on site they were unhelpful and couldn t say if any more stock would be inyroduced. On our last 2 visits what little range there is was very poorly stocked and staff had to look in the back to find basic items like bread.  for the fastest growing product range in terms of demand and need cutting this is very poor and costly to us  as we now need to travel to york to find the required products.

You got the polish & others  but you only get rid of the Irish. Why? Why just the Irish section? Why can t you have them all  the others & the Irish section? It woz a big seller for you. I ve just come back from Ireland someone told me over there that the British a lot of the time go over there just to get the food. Or if they are on holiday they still get loads of the food to take back home because we can t get it from you anymore. They really have to stock up there stuff over there. It is so so wrong. Totally out of order. BRING BACK THE IRISH SECTION! BRING BACK THE IRISH SECTION! BRING BACK THE IRISH SECTION! BRING BACK THE IRISH SECTION! BRING BACK THE IRISH SECTION! BRING BACK THE IRISH SECTION! BRING BACK THE IRISH SECTION! BRING BACK THE IRISH SECTION!

Last time I complained I ws advised it was my fault and should double check my order before checking out. Added to that the minimum spend of £40 when a delivery cost is already in place. Some people such as single people  elderly people and wsick people find it hard to fulfill the previous £25 minimum (which Asda still do). Therefore  will not be using Tesco home delivery again.

The chocolate was fine but the ice cream inside was very gritty and really didn t taste very nice. my daughter was eating one and said it wasn t very nice and asked me to try it  it was horrible i told her to bin that one and get another but this was exactly the same?? unfortunately we don t have the box to show you the batch codes etc as we took them out the put them in the freezer. very unhappy little girl last night without her ice cream. x					2016-09-14T07:27:05+0000	1473838025	2016-09-14 09:27:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I walk in for a product that they didn t stock (i was told by a member of staff not eveything online was in store so fair enough) i picked up a similar product but before purchasing I specifically asked what the return policy was.. well the lady on the till had no idea on return policy (why was she on a till?) So she had to ask they guy on self checkout and he says  as long as you have your recipt your fine  the lady on the till then asked me would you like me to open it now to check if the product is correct I said  I can t do the check now but would be back in the hour if it wasn t correct  I leave thinking all is good  well the product turns out wasn t correct it does not work for me so I go back to return (1hour 10min after purchase) now I am told by the self checkout guy the lady on till has gone home and they can only do returns from 8am untill I think 10pm  I wasn t told this when I asked what the return policy was and i specifically said I would be back in the hour so I ask to speak with a manager (night manger shows up) I explain to him what happend and he is sticking to not being able to do returns at this time and that everyone in store knows the return policy but he apologises for lady who served me and says the lady might need more training  my answere to that is  cleary not everyone in store knows the policys because the lady on till had to ask the guy on self service  how can you have sumone operate a till who isn t fully trained? .. after getting no were with him I asked if he could identify the lady who sold me the product so when I do come back i can be sure the lady is told the whole policy on returns so that this does not happen to another customer.. he told me  we only have one till on at this time  and  i could give you her first name only  that was fine by me I said  thats all i want her first name   then all of a sudden he couldn t give me her name as he didn t know who she was?? He then told me  i am not in charge of her  so I asked to speak to sumone who is and he says  there is a boss higher then me  (out comes the real manager) I explained to him the whole situation and he just wasn t intrested atall he looked at the product and said  it s open I wouldn t return that even if it was the right time  then he walks off just like that! How rude!!. Now I am angry/upset with tescos because I was told when i specifically asked what the return policy was that all is good as long as i keep the recipt.. the lady on till was even going to open the product there and then (i wish I said yes now as it would be on cctv the lady opening the item).. i was sold a product that I could return but when come to return I can t!!?? How can tesco do this?? How could any retailer do this??. After being told by the manager (who shouldnt be a manger in my opinion) that he wouldn t return it even if it was the correct time and after more talking with the night manger I ask to speak again with the real manager.. I walk across to the other side of the store to speak with him and he now says  you can try and return it in the morning but I wouldn t do it  since he knows the situation as to why I am here I asked him if it was possible for him to sign my recipt or sumthing so when I do come back at the correct times I can get a refund he says  no I can t do anything like that as he would need to speak to the lady on till  (I m sorry but the lady on the till when she is asked IF she is even asked is probly going to denie anything were she could be penalised) so it becomes my word against hers?  i shouldn t be left out of pocket due to their staffs lack of knowledge on return policys and the giving of wrong information for example i said  it s like that 40 inch tv there being sold to me as a 50 inch tv it is all your staffs fault as to why I am here and have purchased the wrong product  + after being assured I can return the item opened or not that now I cant  they are basically saying that it s my fault for buying the wrong item.. im sorry but no way would I have purchased it if I couldn t return it I would have happily purchased the correct one from your online service.. I am really not happy with this  this is totally wrong of tesco.. so much for every little helps to me it feels like as little information told helps them! Very very disappointed!.					2016-09-14T01:54:04+0000	1473818044	2016-09-14 03:54:04	0	5	0	0	5	5	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I wonder if it is possible for our local tesco which is Canonmills Edinburgh to invest in one of these. Our son has non verbal autism and a learning disability  he also runs off at every opportunity and has no awareness of danger. We have had to stop taking him for shopping as it s impossible to hold onto him  push a trolley and fill it (even with 2 parents there). Carrying out the weekly shop is an important aspect of daily life which our son is being denied as it s too dangerous for him to attend as we are unable to restrain him. A firefly trolley would help to allow him to be part of this aspect of life so he can learn about the whole aspect of shopping and money 😊 Thank you Tesco - I will look out for one of these trolleys in the future.					2016-09-14T00:37:50+0000	1473813470	2016-09-14 02:37:50	2	2	3	0	5	2	2	0	1	0	2	1	0	0	0	0	0

Last time I we were there  there was loud club music from a very massive boombox in their bakery section. I get it  its a saturday night and they are missing out on all the fun but it was very distracting and inappropriate. We asked to speak to somebody  a manager but all we got was  oh okay  i ll pass the message  we were so fed up that we just left our shopping trolly on the corner and left..not like we manage to shop a lot with all that noise. safe to say we haven t been back since. tesco   i am not saying your staff are not allowed to have fun and I know fully well how draining it can be to work late nights but I just think that reason is not enough to make your customers suffer by letting them listen to loud  inappropriate  and very distracting clubbing music in a grocery store while they try to shop in peace.  yours sincerely  from a first time mom who just wanted a relaxing shop after a long tiring day					2016-09-14T00:05:39+0000	1473811539	2016-09-14 02:05:39	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They attend Suffolk One nearby.  They couldn t find any so they stood near the exit with their purchases while my daughter s friend called a mate to ask where she got hers from. While she was on the phone  a young man who works for Tesco was staring at them. He proceeded to speak into his walkie talkie while staring which made my daughter feel uncomfortable. Her friend finished the call and they payed for their drinks. As they went to leave an older female employee was waiting for them. She stopped them telling them the alarm had sounded - which was a lie - and said she would need to search their bags.  She gave a range of ridiculous reasons for looking through their bags from  your headphones may be an issue  to  make up could cause the problem.  They felt intimidated and as if they had no option so let her look in their bags. It was clear the young man earlier had accused them of stealing so she was checking them out. If she had said this to them honestly I wouldn t have an issue but she told bare faced lies and intimidated them. Shame on you Tesco - 2 innocent 16 year old girls made to feel embarrassed and intimidated - shame on you!					2016-09-13T22:52:05+0000	1473807125	2016-09-14 00:52:05	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I had my 2 year old nephew  7 year old and 10 month old sons and am 6 months pregnant. As I was looking for a parent and child space  I saw a man get from his car without a child. So I carried on looking to see a van parked in one of those spots. Still looking I saw 2 other cars with people getting in or out without children. I complained to your customer service and they said unfortunately there was nothing they could do  they can t even enforce the disabled spaces. When leaving the store  a man in a sports car pulled up in a parent and child space. When I mentioned he didn t have a child he mimicked my words in a sarcastic voice. Charming way to treat a pregnant woman!! So that s 5 cars in total without children I witnessed in a quick shopping trip. Is there anything you can do about this? Otherwise  what s the point in having designated parking?					2016-09-13T22:45:06+0000	1473806706	2016-09-14 00:45:06	0	6	0	0	6	6	1	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Michelle saw us struggling one day and asked if she could do anything to help  I explained that larger stores had the new Firefly trollys for children with complex additional needs  she hadn t heard of them and asked if I could tell her more about them  I brought in the article from a magazine for additional needs parents to show Michelle  from that day on Michelle said she was going to do her best to get one in our local store. As a family we were all delighted to discover a Firefly trolley in store last week  here is Lachlan enjoying trying out the new trolly today.  Thank you so much Michelle for going out of your way to make things easier for us when we are shopping  visits to Lachlan s favourite place will be far less stressful from now on. Thank you to Tesco for helping meet the needs of all your customers  even in a small store.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14316942_10154441253614373_8198526874213769302_n.jpg?oh=6f541b5ca7b31158f04a64b7f72bc294&oe=58E9F1B9	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14316942_10154441253614373_8198526874213769302_n.jpg?oh=ad91f68fef5eb9d106717479c90ba536&oe=58E5B3B4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154441253614373&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-13T22:29:47+0000	1473805787	2016-09-14 00:29:47	714	48	780	67	895	48	39	9	65	0	708	64	2	0	0	0	0

Not only was he 2 hours late he didn t even apologize. He just blamed the store  the packers and customer services! He was also extremely rude to her. When she asked him if he would have given her her alcohol if he d been 10 minutes later he said no as he can t deliver alcohol after 10pm despite her delivery slot being between 7 & 8pm he actually arrived at 9.50pm!					2016-09-13T21:29:49+0000	1473802189	2016-09-13 23:29:49	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I was with my disabled son and on arrival i parked up and saw a member of your staff stood outside obviously waiting for a lift to go home. I asked her if you had a disabled child trolley and she was so helpful and disapeared inside and brought it to me  she was so lovely! Then as we left we were stood outside waiting for the thunderstorms to pass and a lovely young man offered to go and get his coat from the staff room so i could get my son to the car  once again so lovely! Thank you to these two members of staff they are a credit to the company 😊					2016-09-13T21:28:30+0000	1473802110	2016-09-13 23:28:30	20	1	24	4	29	1	1	0	2	0	20	4	0	0	0	0	0

I notice that your chicken sourced from Thailand is very much cheaper than UK sourced chicken  that surprises me as the transport costs must be very high. Could this be because it s cheaply produced in factory farms where chicken welfare is non existent? Can you tell me if a vet is present during the slaughter process and if Tesco monitors the whole process from hatching to slaughter  if so can you please show evidence of this?  I notice that your British produced chicken meat is clearly labelled  a union flag is displayed prominently on the packaging and it seems you want your consumers to know that it is British. Why do you not label the Thai chicken the same? Is it because the public would be  put off ? After all dog and cat is consumed in Thailand  frequently the cats and dogs are boiled or skinned alive  this does make me wonder about how the chickens are slaughtered.  Please can you explain why you import chicken from Thailand  this can t do your carbon foot print much good.					2016-09-13T20:47:13+0000	1473799633	2016-09-13 22:47:13	2	3	2	0	5	3	3	0	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

The wheels were not clean (photo attached) and there was wax smears all over the passenger side of my vehicle but the worst part was the front of my car hadn t even been touched...

I went in to do shopping with my mother while at the checkout the cashier was talking to another customer in bengali (I m assuming) while customers including myself where waiting to be served. The cashier started shouting falsely accusing my mother of assault claiming she pushed another customer. The manager was called down who didn t have a name badge on so I wasn t able to know who I was speaking to  he let the cashier scream and shout at my mother while changing he s story of what had happened  and wasn t to bothered to hear my mothers side. it was only the help of the security guard who told the cashier to be quite and go away because he was screaming and shouting acting in a threatening behaviour. I think this is disgusting and I will never ever be using Bethnal Green tesco again.					2016-09-13T20:13:35+0000	1473797615	2016-09-13 22:13:35	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter Ellie (who is 11) had a coffee afternoon for Macmillan on Saturday. I asked the Bishop Auckland store if they had any donations for her Tombola. They very kindly donated chocolates  wine and prosecco. Which was very much appreciated. She raised a massive £430.05 for Macmillan. Thank you again tesco xxxx					2016-09-13T20:03:26+0000	1473797006	2016-09-13 22:03:26	44	2	44	1	47	2	2	0	2	0	44	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was at 5 diffrent shops last week looking for a swimming costume for my daughter for her swimming lessons. Was in your Coatbridge store only to be told that Tesco sell them at reduced prices to allow winter stock to come in. I m sorry but do tesco forget that people still uses swim wear all year round and not just in the summer. I feel someone needs to be changed and swim wear should be stocked all year round.					2016-09-13T19:58:43+0000	1473796723	2016-09-13 21:58:43	3	6	3	0	9	6	2	4	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Delivery was made late on the Thursday evening and we were only then advised the beer was not available. With less than a day left before the party we had to search other supermarkets to source the items and as we live in a rural location this added to our already tight timescale . No explanation  no apology  from Tesco.  what dreadful customer service and as this was the second time I will never use again.					2016-09-13T19:33:39+0000	1473795219	2016-09-13 21:33:39	1	12	1	0	13	12	3	9	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s been pierced and has gone completely mouldy inside. As a busy mother rushing around the store to buy my essentials I often don t take the time to inspect everything I pick up as I trust you as a retailer to be providing quality control when you are unpacking and stacking the shelves in store to ensure everything you supply is fresh and not damaged. This has obviously been damaged for some time given the amount of decay inside the jar. I will think twice before buying bulk jars in store in future.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14291714_10206522285167610_2271969498470020204_n.jpg?oh=1b55ded2176fa1a7ebb6267a2ef63b00&oe=5921CE25	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14291714_10206522285167610_2271969498470020204_n.jpg?oh=95cb0c3079f33d3fe47e1e7f9c42c76f&oe=58D69528	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206522285167610&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-13T18:18:58+0000	1473790738	2016-09-13 20:18:58	2	7	2	0	9	6	4	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

As you can see below  once opened they were surprised to find 2 bits of furry green mould on the block!! 😷😩 This was brand new  bought in one of your stores a couple of weeks ago  sat in the fridge & hadn t been opened until today. The use by date is 30/10/2016  so no reason why it should already have mould on!! Really disappointed!  This is one of the double packs & we haven t even bothered to open the second block as it has the same use by date so maybe has the same mould! Of course we could just cut off the mould & eat it  but the price you pay for Cathedral City I really shouldn t have to! I expect quality & this is just gross & not really good enough 😣 For your info it was purchased from Tesco on Edinburgh Way in Harlow  Essex. We don t have receipt anymore though & don t even know how much we paid for it. Look forward to your response!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14358868_10157516230430352_8312617472897580481_n.jpg?oh=83efb585c97313cb6fcc314053395a41&oe=591AD9CD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14358868_10157516230430352_8312617472897580481_n.jpg?oh=73a18f635df5775931cacc8ac7bd0d90&oe=58EB3FC0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157516230430352&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-13T18:14:54+0000	1473790494	2016-09-13 20:14:54	0	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	4	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

Are your checkout operatives instructed to put raw chicken and meat products in plastic bags? On several occasions  i have had to ask them to put my raw meat products into bags  in particular chicken. Some staff do it regularly however  most don t. Knowing the kind of bacteria present on raw meat products and its packaging especially chicken  i would have thought this would be standard procedure to prevent contamination.					2016-09-13T17:53:13+0000	1473789193	2016-09-13 19:53:13	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now......I m going to assume that a meeting took place somewhere within the walls of Tesco head office and a discussion was had between lots of important people to find a new and exciting Xmas product  a product to wow the British public  to show what Xmas is truly about?  Something like this?   Mr Tesco Head Office Guy:  I have an idea!! How about chocolate reindeers? Fun yet festive   Other Tesco H/O Folk:  nah  to cliché   Mr Tesco Head Office Guy:  ok then....maybe a chocolate sleigh?   Other Tesco H/O Folk:  hmmm still a bit too stereotypical  ASDA would probably do that   Mr Tesco Head Office Guy: 💡  I ve got it......a small box of chocolate potatoes   Other Tesco H/O Folk:  OMG....genius!!!!!!

This is the 4th occasion on non specific random days that i have gone into your aylesbury extra store to print out some photos using the two machines you have recently installed and it s the 4th time both the machines have been out of order  run out of ink and or paper or a combination of the above. Can i ask why you offer a service in this store that you evidently cannot support? Its  obviously managed by a 3rd party yet no staff members or customer service seem to know anything about it! So unbelievably frustrating when Ive made repeated specific trips in to the store to use this facility. What was i advised when i and another customer (who was also disappointed for the umpteenth time) told? Why don t you drive into town and use supersnaps!

Holyhead (the largest supermarket for a good 20 miles) stocks 12 different types of frozen chips (I counted) but no sugar free confectionery. When I asked about this I was told there is  diabetic jam  and a Gluten free section.    I guess I ll have to find wherever it is all the other local diabetics shop now  because Tesco sure doesn t fit the bill!					2016-09-13T16:17:09+0000	1473783429	2016-09-13 18:17:09	3	6	3	0	9	6	3	3	2	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

But he even said that they are a discontinued item at this store. But the next best he could offer was a pack of 4 small organic apples @ £1.25. No thanks  not when I used to be able to get 6 for 89p. These Rosedale apples were perfect in size  for both of my children. Please bring them back.

Unfortunately I wouldnt know.... I ordered it on the monday  click and collect next day delivery to nearest store. With a couple of other items. As I ordered it said collection Wednesday. I thought ok thats cool no drama. On the Wednesday I get a text order delayed till Thursday. Nothing more than a bit disgruntled an extra day  thats fine I can live with it.. Thursday comes around as it does every week. 2/3 items were in store when I went to collect. Wheres my 3rd item? Sales assistant informs me its in stoke come back tomorrow (friday).. you guessed it still wasnt there same on Saturday same on Sunday. (I know craig david had a better seven days) monday I go in still not there. So today is Tuesday I call up customer service tobbe informed that on saturday tescos cancelled my order and refunded it as game was out of stock.. but the game ia now in stock if I want to reorder but tue catch is I have to pay a delivery charge on it. When it was with original order it met the £30 threshold. Now because its got to be a seperate order and ive been left without the satisfaction that only Rayman can provide I have to pay more?   Im deeply saddened by this and there is a hole in my life shaped like Rayman.					2016-09-13T16:10:33+0000	1473783033	2016-09-13 18:10:33	7	12	8	1	21	12	5	7	6	0	7	1	0	0	0	0	0

Threw an approved partner of tesco  original order went missing in transit 😳 re-ordered same has happened again spoke to customer service to be told it would be sent out again but I would receive phone calls every step of the way 👌🏼  Then receive an email saying request for refund has been approved 😳 ring CS to be told they won t be sending it and refund given 😫 I didn t want a refund I wanted the wallpaper I had originally ordered and not with all the messing about I have had so will definitely not be ordering of tesco direct again  thanks for the wonderful customer service!!!

I used to be able to walk around the store and get the items I needed without a problem- in fact I was so good if my partner went without me and couldn t find an item I could direct him by phone as to where it was 😂 Today I spent 15 mins looking for an item and couldn t find it  I finally admitted defeat and asked one of your staff for help. The poor lad was as lost as I was and felt as frustrated as me ( probably more as I can bet he gets asked a gazillion times a day! ) Just so you know  moving items around does NOT make we want to buy the different item that s in its place. If I want to buy chili sauce  I am not going to buy baked beans instead. My 20 min trip today took nearly 45 mins.

This inconsistent approach can cause confusion as people may think a product that isn’t labelled will be unsuitable for vegans  even if it contains no animal products. I strongly urge you to label all of your own-brand products that are free of animal ingredients and animal exploitation as being suitable for vegans.					2016-09-13T15:05:31+0000	1473779131	2016-09-13 17:05:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I don t have the receipt as they fitted well  however after less than 2 weeks of actually wearing them  the one shoe is faulty as the button to turn the flashing lights on and off won t work and the shoe is constantly flashing. If I take them into store would it be possible to exchange them without a receipt? Thanks					2016-09-13T14:28:30+0000	1473776910	2016-09-13 16:28:30	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to the store today with my 3 year old and 9 week old boys. My youngest was very tired and upset so I carried him around while shopping. The helpful staff unpacked my shopping to pay  packed my shopping and staff in the car park even helped push the trolley back to my car. My eldest son was quite happy as he enjoyed a free banana while shopping 🙂. Thank you					2016-09-13T10:56:07+0000	1473764167	2016-09-13 12:56:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Yesterday I saw something that made me very sad in one of your stores (st rollox  Glasgow).   It isn t the most affluent of areas  and there s a system in place where people have to queue for reduced items  rather than fighting over them  as they are very popular.  As I was paying for my items  I noticed this happening  but what I also noticed was that some the staff were laughing at the situation  in full view if the customers. While it was an unusual situation  I couldn t help but put myself in one of the customers shoes - they can t help being poor  and I know if that had been me  I would have felt embarrassed and belittled. Please remember they are paying customers and people too! Have a word with the staff there maybe?  Acknowledgement of this post would be appreciated greatly.					2016-09-13T06:20:11+0000	1473747611	2016-09-13 08:20:11	8	7	8	0	15	7	3	4	4	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

I went to Tesco Express this morning  and upon paying I used the same clubcard I always use. (never had a problem before!)   It was then pointed out  that the name on the card said  Mrs J Field . I didn t deny this and promptly told the cashier that this was my wife. She then told me  that I was therefore unable to use the card as it wasn t my name on it?  I told her I ve never been aware that this was a problem  and I ve not yet been refused before due to this.   Upon looking on your website  I cannot see anything that would disallow me the use of my wife s card? In fact  a certain paragraph suggests that I can use it. - albeit with the wording fob  but surely this is purely semantics? (I will attach the paragraph.)  Upon checking on the  My clubcard  section  it would seem that these points have not been added  and were therefore cancelled.   I didn t take a receipt (saving the planet  one sheet of paper at a time!)  so I m therefore unable to take it to another store now  to get them put on either. (I did however pay by card  so I can therefore prove purchase).   So where do I stand? Am i wrong for using this card? In this day and age  is it not rather presumptuous  that she assumed the card wasn t mine? (I am of course being facetious).   Let me know  because this was pointed out in front of other customers  not quietly I may add. Being that it is my local store  I visit it quite often. And don t want find myself in that situation again  trying to explain myself  where I feel no explanation should be necessary.   I look forward to your reply!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14355775_10157497594975014_1848846559396149452_n.jpg?oh=2c04cd50d793e09049322ecd552d9eef&oe=58EA0BDE	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14355775_10157497594975014_1848846559396149452_n.jpg?oh=1c05990dbc7170cf9768cc643f47596e&oe=59197DD3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157497594975014&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-13T05:52:23+0000	1473745943	2016-09-13 07:52:23	6	7	6	0	13	6	3	3	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I noticed an English flag on the label  presumably to denote the origin of the cow that produced the milk. That s fine.  Then I remembered some publicity you had a few weeks ago about strawberries grown in Scotland  and how Tesco had removed the Scottish flag and replaced it with a Union flag after complaints from customers.  Can you explain your flag branding policy please. I don t understand it. If I complain about an English flag on your milk  will you replace it with a Union flag  too?					2016-09-13T05:51:58+0000	1473745918	2016-09-13 07:51:58	2	5	2	0	7	5	1	4	5	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I purchased a healthy living prawn mayonnaise sandwich with a other things. While tucking into my sandwich I almost choked on god knows what. I managed to remove this object from my mouth and headed straight to the nearest tescoes. @tescowalworthroad. I ask the gentleman at the cashier desk if he was the manager and he confirmed. I explained what had happened and showed him the remaining sandwich and the foreign object. He proceeded ask me what the object was. I said to him i wasn t sure. He then turned and said to me   well if you don t know what it is neither do I so it must be apart of the sandwich  at first i thought it was joke and he was trying to wind me up but he wasn t. He then showed it to his colleague and apprehensively agreed with him. I then asked both of them if they were being serious. I explained to him I could have almost choked on it and he still insisted it must be apart of the sandwich. In shock i asked how could it be apart of the sandwich when it isn t piece of prawn or mayonnaise which all the sandwich consisted of. He then suggested it must be a piece of oat from the bread. He then responded with you ve already eaten half of the sandwich I don t know what you expect me do about it. In total dismay I picked up my bag and left the store. I paused outside the store and thought i cant be the only person who has been treated like this and it is totally unacceptable service. So I returned and asked for his name. He refused point blank to tell me his name to the point he made a smart remark that his name is duty manager and I can tell whoever I speak to that i spoke to the duty manager. Conveniently he wasn t wearing his name badge either. I ve shopped tescoes practically 15 odd years this is the first time I have ever experienced such appalling service. The fact that I returned to a store with a complaint regarding safety issues with food and to be treated like I trying to con or mislead them is beyond me especially for a half eaten £1.90 sandwich. I m absolutely disgusted to know someone was more concerned about a half eaten sandwich than the fact could have choked to death and to be perfectly honest I have no interest in shopping tescoes again after that experience.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14344315_10157406728785162_9109005690196250378_n.jpg?oh=e19d0be9a9c52b3b2a0c0da5919fce5c&oe=59207D97	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14344315_10157406728785162_9109005690196250378_n.jpg?oh=79a279faaade199921653818b747a295&oe=58E5BB9A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157406728785162&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-13T00:59:43+0000	1473728383	2016-09-13 02:59:43	3	1	3	4	8	1	1	0	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

I specifically went to buy some ice pops for my kids as it s rather warm over the next few days. On the shelves  it said one flavour was reduced to clear  one reduced in price but a normal label  and one flavour at full price. How long will these take to show up on my favourites on the shopping app please?

It s just my life is already like some kind of sleep deprived episode of the  krypton Factor without throwing in dales super market sweep into the mix  as I m usually dragging round 1 small child and a baby  and it would be great if we could get to the end of the shopping trip without all of us crying... please stop hiding stuff from me  and please can you put back the following items into your central chelmsford store so I can once again enjoy the delights of a successful shopping trip:  Schwarz tuna neopolitana mix  Tesco finest haddock melt in the middle fish cakes (this was my emergency meal replacement for the above  but you d gotten rid of it as well  I lost my mind a little at this point) Sweet cure bacon  Tesco finest goat cheese crisps Leffe brun Leffe nectar  I think there is probably more  but I m too tired to remember at the moment...  I promise to buy it all lots and lots of you do bring them back. Maybe sales of booze had gone down due to my pregnancy? It s OK now though as after obliterating my adult social life by having children I now just sit at home in the evening wistfully lamenting my golden days with a tear in my eye and a glass of leffe  after a fish cake and a cheeky bag of crisps (if I can hide them long enough from my son)  Many thanks  P.s. my son likes the free fruit  and then more tasters when we get to the demonstration station where he gets spoilt rotten.					2016-09-12T23:43:39+0000	1473723819	2016-09-13 01:43:39	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Our local tescos express has been periodically selling and then removing goats milk from stock. My mum has complained in store and written letters to managers several times before and has received them putting it back in stock just to remove it again! This has happened several times! Surely if they re going to agree to put an item in stock they should keep it in stock? The nearest other place to sell it is a drive away at the next village  hardly a convenience. I d just like to ask if it s possible to put it back in stock and permanently this time?  But must say they did brilliantly with adding more to the free-from range as my mother is also a coeliac :)					2016-09-12T21:56:43+0000	1473717403	2016-09-12 23:56:43	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst they are mostly clean  the loo roll holders are hanging off   the hand dryers are less than useless and the automatic soap dispensers have been replaced with home brand squirty soap. They ve been like this a fair while and  really let the store down. I m not complaining.  Just bringing it to your attention.					2016-09-12T21:36:58+0000	1473716218	2016-09-12 23:36:58	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

When I got to the till with my large trolley of shopping there was no queue  so I started putting my items straight onto the conveyer belt. The guy on the till said hello and started scanning my items as I was still putting them on the belt the other end. You can imagine the pile of stuff that was waiting for me when I went to go pack.  When I asked him for 5 bags he counted each one  then recounted them a further 2 times before handing them over to me.  The guy didn t really talk to me  he squashed my bread when he scanned it but I waited patiently whilst he took his time  especially when trying to scan the awkward items.  By the time I went to pay I had already worked it out  so I counted out my money with him  which he obviously recounted and then counted my change out two times.  But you know every moment of that was just perfect. I asked him how he was finding the job and he chatted a bit about his experience of Tesco and how they had given him an opportunity many other employers hadn t. See this guy is Autistic. As a mother of a 12 year Autistic boy this makes my heart smile. Changing attitudes teamed with employers  like you  who really do offer equal opportunities are a changing people s lives. So thank you Tesco  it was a pleasure shopping with you today.					2016-09-12T21:14:15+0000	1473714855	2016-09-12 23:14:15	109161	2652	120879	7468	130999	2605	2177	428	2951	0	108089	11155	344	40	9	7	0

No lifting  no bending at the cooker  to leave cooking to me and also been given numerous talks by health professionals on how important eating regular meals is  especially as she has had a uterine  bladder and wound infection since the section and is really suffering bless her. The solution to this was to buy in ready meals or things that just needed shoving in the oven as even I can manage that.   Now she loves quiche  so I got a crustless cheese and onion one and some salad garnish with oven chips. Imagine my horror when the only other foods I d bought in was fresh chicken in those foil dishes but had put them in the freezer and I got the quiche out only to find the tesco bakers had baked the grease proof paper into the quiche! Please see photo. I tried to get it out chiselling it with a butter knife but there s loads of it  deep set in the quiche. This meant I had to go out and get us a KFC  which meant she took her antibiotics late as she has to take them after a meal  and was left alone again with the baby while I went and fetched us food. I know it s not tescos fault my partner is unwell with post c section infections  nor is it tescos fault that she needed the section  but it is tescos fault that the quiche has baked in paper!!   Instead of tesco makin life easier they ve tonight made it harder and a little more expensive!   Unfortunately I do not have the receipt for the quiche as don t keep the weekly shop receipts  or would have taken it back to the Rotherham centre store I purchased it in.   Not very good tesco!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14238282_1134956959902798_7609334432687810516_n.jpg?oh=cd48a2ce56e01aa6b41b44a81bc43ec5&oe=5922AE47	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14238282_1134956959902798_7609334432687810516_n.jpg?oh=0a589c9a9e80aa408da7e1ccc7496c51&oe=58E85052	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1134956959902798&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-12T20:56:11+0000	1473713771	2016-09-12 22:56:11	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am a student who does not have access to a car and is staying at a BnB currently. I ordered food to supply me through the end of my placement here to be delivered today at 3pm. By 5pm when my delivery had STILL not arrived  I opened an online help chat as I don t have phone coverage here to make a call. I was told that the driver couldn t find the VERY SPECIFIC address I gave and decided to not deliver. After almost an hour of discussing and explaining and being told this was not Tesco s fault in the slightest  I got the representative to agree to redeliver my order at 6:30pm tonight (I also supplied an additional contact number incase the driver again got lost). It s now 9pm. NO SIGN of any driver  NO PHONE CALL. I now have no food for the evening  no breakfast and no car to drive and get any. I am VERY disappointed with Tesco and their home delivery. At this point  I highly doubt I ll ever give my service to this company again even if it is the more convenient option.					2016-09-12T20:08:25+0000	1473710905	2016-09-12 22:08:25	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It says 800 approx on the packet but only had 737 in it. I feel robbed!! 😮 That s nowhere near 800.  I saved up ages for these and was so excited. I ll never save a pound for anything again!! 😭  Granted some would say that I m sad and that I m wasting my time counting them. I just call it being thorough. These things need to be checked.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14317567_972709472841396_3719484468050257872_n.jpg?oh=4e800f63951e83f5128d276a7fb25cea&oe=58E18986	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14317567_972709472841396_3719484468050257872_n.jpg?oh=109bccc092d3a4c8c84c9494afd2d88f&oe=58DE9579	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=972709472841396&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-12T19:44:33+0000	1473709473	2016-09-12 21:44:33	4	5	6	4	15	5	4	1	14	0	4	0	0	2	0	0	0

I don t have time to shop daily so need to buy enough to last the week. Firstly ever fresh item I wanted to buy had a shelf life of 1 or 2 days maximum and lots of it was dated that day but not reduced. Anyway I bought some jacket potatoes for dinner tomorrow night and have just gone to prepare them ready for the slow cooker and they are rotten and stink! I have an important meeting tomorrow night regarding schooling for my daughter so needed a quick tea  but now that has gone out of the window! I normally shop at Aldi and can guarantee their potatoes for about 2 weeks along with fruit. The fruit I bought from your store has gone mouldy already so has gone in the bin along with the potatoes! Looks like I will be going back to Aldi  they might always be busy and rush you through the tills but at least I can buy my food for a week! This really isn t good enough Tesco!!					2016-09-12T19:39:01+0000	1473709141	2016-09-12 21:39:01	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Now you need a fair few tacos to feed this brood let me tell you! Living in a fairly small village with expensive little convenience shops is why I do my  every little helps   shop at Tesco.

It seems your plate wasn’t compatible with Waitrose ready meals (Not sure if that’s deliberate). As far as I’m aware a curry  some rice and a small ramekin with mango chutney in shouldn’t be a plate breaker.   what happened next was nothing short of a curry-tastrophe.   I picked up the plate with one hand and a glass of pepsi max in the other. The plate then disintegrated in my hand  leaving just a shard of plate left in my determined  hungry grip. The shocking picture below illustrates the velocity of crisis we had on our hands. Unfortunately Tesco  my floor wasn’t hungry.  During the event a small piece of plate did a small action flip and sliced my hand. As you can see from the picture of my injury (top comment on post)  this is no laughing matter  I think you can just see through to the bone in one place. What if a child or small  cute labrador puppy was to carry one of these plates? It could be fatal. What a danger. I’m sure you don’t willingly want to sell death on your shelves.  I no longer have the receipt. To be honest upon purchasing I didn’t foresee that the product I was buying might one day attempt to assassinate me.  My girlfriend laughed at me through the whole occasion  which has now caused friction to our once perfect relationship. Also  what hurts the most. The small ramekin  housing my Waitrose Mango Chutney dip  was a gift. From my mother. She bought it for me (kindly) whilst away  on holiday  with my dad  in the Isle of Wight. This Tesco  you cannot replace.  I have a few simple demands to settle this hard time for me and my family: Relationship counselling An all expenses trip to the Isle of Wight to re-buy that mini dipping bowl. A new kitchen floor. cleaning expenses. a curry replacement pack. Hand insurance (what if it gets infected?). Counselling to help me build back my confidence in holding plates and other kitchenware.  I look forward to hearing from you and hope you can shed some light on the situation.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14238089_10153855397621569_7033461153441124672_n.jpg?oh=87be14a9efe96af5ef17ca76c6b12d89&oe=5918D029	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/q83/s720x720/14238089_10153855397621569_7033461153441124672_n.jpg?oh=e30e2e2dde82c5e3f0fbbcecae86f542&oe=58EC9564	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153855397621569&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-12T19:06:11+0000	1473707171	2016-09-12 21:06:11	300	68	369	37	474	66	43	23	119	0	294	9	0	60	0	0	0

I am a non-european citizen and I tried to buy beer and was asked for an ID. When I showed my driver s license  which is accepted absolutely EVERYWHERE in Ireland  I was informed that I needed to show my passport.   I would like to kindly ask you  attentive attendant that is reading this message right now: do have your passport with you? Also  would you consider Ireland safe enough to bring your passport with you everywhere you go  just in case you want to buy any alcohol from Tesco (because it is the only place who requires such a thing!)?   Seriously. When are companies going to start to think about the customer experience in order to start providing a decent service?

My delivery was 2 hours late meaning I didn t have time to cook the Sunday lunch that I had ordered. I had to go out to the shops (not tesco) to purchase a 2nd lot of food so it would be ready in time for our visitors. I paid £60 for a delivery saver to avoid having to go to the shops with my 2 kids and to be able to chose 1 hour slots so my day wasn t wasted and this is the 2nd consecutive time my Sunday delivery has been late. 😤😤					2016-09-12T18:39:38+0000	1473705578	2016-09-12 20:39:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Why do you feel the need to put caster sugar in a mix of white and red cabbage  carrot and red onion in a cider vinegar? It s so spoiled a gorgeous healthy mix and it has also spoiled it for us! We used to love having this on the side with steak  pasta  sweet potato. Anything  you name it! but now we can t have it because it is covered in sugar.  Please can the sugar be removed? there is simply no need for it.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14238126_251008608626991_8521896770931047704_n.jpg?oh=0fc8ae33524f2ffa4d67371018fba4a3&oe=58EC4617	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14238126_251008608626991_8521896770931047704_n.jpg?oh=8ed5d71878041644daf7a77e27bef064&oe=58E600E8	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=251008608626991&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-12T18:34:01+0000	1473705241	2016-09-12 20:34:01	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Please could you like and share this post and see if we can return a special item to a close friend.   My friends visited Tesco Extra  Town Gate Retail Park on the Birmingham Road  Dudley on Friday 9th September between 6-7pm. Whilst on their way to the store her daughter was playing with her engagement and wedding ring (she has leant not to let her play with them again!). When they parked up they got out of the car forgetting their daughter had the rings. She managed to find her engagement ring but her wedding ring could not be found. It s looking very likely that the ring was lost on the car park when her daughter stood up and fell out of her dress.    They have searched and searched the car park  re visited the car park and the store several times and have left contact details with the store but as yet  the ring hasn t been handed in.   Details: 3mm ladies platinum court ring and as all wedding rings  carry sentimental value.    Please could you share and hopefully someone has found it and doesn t know who it belongs too.   Facebook is great for this kind of thing so fingers crossed we find it  for  Lucy Almond Jones and Paul Jones					2016-09-12T18:22:57+0000	1473704577	2016-09-12 20:22:57	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

A bit of a silly thing if their on the shelf as that says they are available to buy.					2016-09-12T17:57:40+0000	1473703060	2016-09-12 19:57:40	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I picked up the Samsung tablet I had ordered yesterday from my local store. Once opened this afternoon I ve found the anti tamper seal to be broken  although the item looks newly packaged the screen clearly has finger marks on it so is clearly not new.

So rude for you to be standing with your hand outstretched waiting for your change/card/receipt and the cashier puts it on the packing area. So difficult to pick things up from there  especially cards. Worse when you re in a wheelchair and can t see where she s put your change.  Massive pet hate  seems to be happening more and more.					2016-09-12T17:14:40+0000	1473700480	2016-09-12 19:14:40	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just done my usual shop at your Martlesham store and just arrived home . Upon arriving home and unpacking I noticed that my milk has 2 lids top and bottom (pictured) this has made me question life in general . I am now very confused as to weather milk should have the opening at the top or bottom ? I see the benefits of both but am now scared to use the milk incase I m using it the wrong way up an don t want to insult or offend the poor milk carton . I do hope you can advise me on what I should do as this could get messy when my son makes his breakfast tomorrow or should I just lose the 99p it cost me and maybe donate it to the circus ?? Please help tesco your my favourite childhood food shop outlet but my dreams are crushed and now I m confused . For the remainder of the day you will find me and my double lid milk hiding under stairs regards ashley	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14316937_824949540938862_3936441915192945720_n.jpg?oh=52c6e75a3b0f25a675d401ded361c12a&oe=591A131C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14316937_824949540938862_3936441915192945720_n.jpg?oh=f86aa479f8a4d230c2907e83e2b9ee16&oe=58E34FE3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=824949540938862&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-12T16:24:23+0000	1473697463	2016-09-12 18:24:23	13	26	22	10	58	26	9	17	40	0	12	0	0	8	0	0	0

Obviously made a rookie error in only buying three of these though  since it appears he can t even stay clean past breakfast (that must be a boy thing!)😖 So I ll just nip to tesco in the first week and get a pack of plain tops  yeah? Or no  as they have every size except the one we need 😔  Let s drive to another store at the weekend then? Loads of yellow  but still none in our size. You can check stock you say? Oh and they are in stock in the first store 🤔 Let s call the next day to pick some up....   Excuse me where are the yellow school tops?  Schools gone back now so we sent them back 😠. You can order online....but delivery costs more than the tops 😩😩😩	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14291852_10157435297455287_2512486217842541533_n.jpg?oh=7da03ab153520222d5bfd784c9a60ff5&oe=58DA6D6F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14291852_10157435297455287_2512486217842541533_n.jpg?oh=10fc54aa5dc075062dfe5922d16b40d8&oe=58DDF162	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157435297455287&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-12T15:54:24+0000	1473695664	2016-09-12 17:54:24	6	4	6	0	10	4	2	2	2	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is in an area with one of the highest percentages of Welsh speakers in Cardiff and bilingual signs mean a great deal to us. Is this a plan to phase out the use of Welsh in your stores?

I m not sure if you remember me but I had a small problem with a £7.50 pop-up tent last week. Yes  I m back  unfortunately the Tale of the Tent does not end with you and I spending a long weekend camping in the Cotswolds  however I m sure you d be disappointed if I cut out all the  good  parts which lead to Terence the Tent being abandoned in a field along with the dignity of a thousand festival goers.   After last weeks failed attempt to return Terence #1 back to its cover of eternal doom  I decided I would not be so crazy as to open up Terence #2 in fear of another 4 hour fight  a calculated risk I was willing to take to save my mental health.   Now  I don t want you to think that my relationship with Terence #2  was a total mistake  we had some good times  he was lightweight and easy to transport which was a blessing as I had other bags and enough alcohol to sedate 2 rugby teams and Paul Gascoigne. Terence #2  as we all remember was extremely easy to erect (no profanities this time) and after being wake since 5am to get to Bestival  my comrades and I were a little tired. As my travelling partners laid out their complicated temporary homes  string and canvas filled the floor as sweat and swearing filled the air  I  on the other hand released Terence #2 like a cheap  slightly underwhelming dove at a wedding.   As I stood over T2 like a proud dad who s son had just lost his virginity  I went to finish the job and pin down the necessary areas with pegs and guy ropes.....erm...Where s the guy ropes?  A double check of the instructions confirms there should be 4 of them so i searched high and low but they were not to be found.   Issue 1 of part 2. No guy ropes.   Undeterred I put 6 pegs in the 2 hoops that were attached to the base and started to fill T2 with my camping goodies  1st up was my average size inflatable bed  please see picture 1 that I have added.   Issue 2 of part 2. Not big enough for an inflatable bed to fit in comfortably.   After some gentle wriggling and jiggling the inflatable bed filled the base and Terence and I was ready to take our relationship to the next level. As I crawled inside him I shuddered in anticipation  pulling my bedding over myself ready to gaze at his insides  I attempt to stretch out only to find that I can no longer starfish as I had done previously. Not only is Terence not big enough to lay a mattress in  but anything taller than a note pad means that the walls lean in drastically and one is no longer able to stretch  some basic physics I was not expecting to think about.   Issue 3 of part 2. The phrase  fetal position only  good luck  was not added to the packaging.   So  night 1 I drunkardly stumbled to bed relatively early  it had been a long day  but I woke a mere couple of hours later with cramp that could disable a rhino  I then realised that size does matter and the next 2 nights were going to be uncomfortable. As regret of my bargain buy grew and the determination to make things work with Terence fell  day 2 was going to be even longer.   On night 2 surley it couldn t get worse  I knew what was coming up and I was ready  then it rained. As I laid in Terence looking up at pools of water forming above me I remained perfectly  still as any movement meant the Chinese water torture would begin and a second night  this time a little wetter  of less sleep than I was expecting to have anyway.   Issue 4 of part 2. Not waterproof  not even a little bit. See second picture.   This bit I ll keep short. One of the peg holes ripped off and Terence was only secured by 1 end. My sense of humour then left me so quick i thought we d had a 1 night stand.   Issue 5 of part 2. It fell apart.   The next bit is not nothing to do with you but i feel its relevant to mention that one of my  friends  kept turning my tent around to deepen my Misery.   Issue 6 of part 2. Horrible friends.   So  as I sit here now in my own home with a comfortable bed  I look back at my time with Terence with half a smile and an appointment with the chiropractor  I feel I should leave the world some advice.   THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BARGAIN TENT!!  Until next time Tesco. Na Nu Na Nu  Still yours lovingly.

I have a handful of it in my smoothie every morning and when I opened it on Saturday morning I thought it was a bit wet. By Sunday morning it was beginning to smell like compost and this morning it was past it. I buy it regularly and it should not go like this so quickly.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14264840_10154460675500883_9057236161974404451_n.jpg?oh=94dbfbca75c4ca6d96ed637864ead327&oe=58E3CFDB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14264840_10154460675500883_9057236161974404451_n.jpg?oh=a61e256fbb1032f54184ece771f0861d&oe=5924733D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154460675500883&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-12T09:53:13+0000	1473673993	2016-09-12 11:53:13	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On August 2nd I purchased a television from a Tesco Extra branch. As I was on holiday at the time  we didn t actually open the box until we returned home at the end of August.  My son  whom the television was bought for  used the set twice with no issues  but when he went to switch the television on for a third time - it wouldn t work. It still doesn t work. Last week I called the number on my receipt and was told that I could return the television to my local branch of Tesco Extra. However  when we returned the boxed television in to store  it became apparent that we had made a wasted journey as Tesco policy is not to exchange brand new televisions that are faulty (not what I was informed on the phone).  Instead  I had to bring the television home again and book an appointment for a repair. I am currently waiting between 9am and 7pm  have had to lose money by taking time off work  and if the repairman cannot fix the television  we have to use more petrol returning it to the store we ve already been to. I m feeling rather disappointed by all of this and don t understand why I couldn t get an exchange as I was told originally on the phone. I m losing out financially here.

Someone has to stand up to these disgusting people who run local business into the ground and offer the most disgusting service as replacement!!!   Dear Sir/Madam    I am writing to you regarding several incidents that have happened since using Tesco online shopping. I would like to request that I receive a response to this email in due course. I also wish to inform you that  so bad was the service I have received that this might take a while to explain as there are several complaints I am submitting.    After receiving the toaster item above I decided that I wasn’t keen on the style and so decided to return the item. I made a phone call and it was agreed that I could return the item to a store close by to where I work. To my knowledge I was advised to go to Cavendish Street Tesco. Upon my arrival I was greeted and told that they would not be able to refund the cost of the item in that particular store. I contacted the help centre and spoke to a lady who gave me the address for an alternative Tesco on Dean Street. Baring in mind it was my lunch break I proceeded on to the next store. When I arrived at Dean street Tesco I was then told that I was unable to get a refund due to the item being from a third party supplier. I had already been made aware that this was the case but was reassured on my original phone call that the store would take my item. I left the shop with my item still unreturned and as you can imagine rather frustrated. It was 30oc and I was running around London like a headless chicken  I had not  been able to get lunch and I was late back from work due to the situation. I returned to work and again made another phone call and was reassured that the store was in the wrong and that they would have to take the item. I returned to Dean Street Tesco a few days later with the Toaster. The same thing was relayed to me again  I was unable to return the item as the store did not have the facilities to process a refund. Again another lunch break wasted. This had been the third time that I had been to a Tesco store and turned away. I spoke with another Telephone representative who apologetically broke the news  that I had been miss informed not by one of your operators but three different members of your phone operating team told me the same thing. THREE members of your team miss informed me. All calls were logged on the system and so I urge you to listen back to all calls for confirmation of my allegation. The final operator I spoke to offered to give me an email address and contact Clever Box directly but after having wasted so much of my time already I did not see why it was still my responsibility to figure out how to get the item returned. Taking into to account the messing around I think it’s an absolute insult that Tesco did not offer to take full responsibility of the item and arrange to have it collect in the first place. After standing my ground I was offered a £10 compensation refund and an email address to contact clever box on. I’m happy to say Clever box were a lot more responsive to me than the service I had received from Tesco. They were terrified that I had been miss advised so many times and due to the previous  issues offered to except the item free of charge. They basically took the responsibility for the mistakes made by Tesco. You’ll learn this is not the first time Tesco have failed to take responsibility if you read on.     Incident No 2   28/08/2016   For some reason my Club Card attached to my account has not been updated. I made a phone on the 28/08/2016  and spoke to a representative. After being left on hold for some time I was told that I would receive a phone call back once the issue had been looked into… I’m still waiting for my club card points to be updated and I still haven’t received a phone call.       Date: Wednesday 31stth Aug 2016   Ref : 21000635   At 21.10  I received a text to say that my home delivery had been delayed and that I should expect for it to arrive between 21:00 and 23:55. I spoke to a representative that confirmed that the driver had been delayed and would be late. I was also made aware that it’s against company policy to have vehicles on residential roads after 11pm. I was also informed that if I wanted to reschedule the delivery for the following day I would be recharged for the home delivery and also the shopping. I appreciate this would’ve been refunded at a later date  but I would like to know why the responsibility of  something so beyond my control would then be put back on to me? We’re not discussing a £20 shopping bill but a little under £100 bill which I was going to be charged twice for until a refund was given. I was offered a £5 voucher as a sorry and was thanked for my patience. Now I’d like for someone to put themselves in my shoes. It’s an insult to be offered £5 when your delivery driver turns up at the front at 11:45pm. I can’t actually believe that that’s the best you had to offer. As if it’s acceptable to have someone waiting up until that time. Now I’d like to make a few points. I wouldn’t get out of bed for £5. The very foundations of our society are partly based on  presentation  punctuality and reliability and I have been failed on all three  at every point of contact during all my experiences. I actually had a phone call from the store manager who called to apologise but then proceeded to ask me if I know why the delivery driver was late? Why on earth would he be asking me? Surely the professional thing to do would’ve been to gather his information before making a phone call of apology to me. It came across like he didn’t know what he was apologising for.     I suppose you would like to know what I would like the outcome of this complaint to be. Quite frankly I’m not sure why I should have to pay for shopping that not only arrived late but broke your rules and regulations. There is no excuse for calling someone’s doorbell at that hour especially when the lady below is an elderly and very easily confused.   Please note that if I don’t get a response I will not be suing Tesco services again as I’m going to need something to rebuild my trust in a brand that has shown no sign of organisation or punctuality or respect for me. I think it’s an absolute shame that the lack of communication and customer awareness is letting the brand.     I look forward to hearing your response    Yours Sincerely 					2016-09-12T08:03:01+0000	1473667381	2016-09-12 10:03:01	0	6	1	0	7	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

I want to say a big thank you to Sean McKellican at your call centre in Dundee. I ordered some Safari Park tickets using my clubcard points and they re now emailed to you instead of posted (which is great!) But the email had gone adrift in my Spam folder and been automatically deleted so myself and family were sat here  picnic at the ready with no tickets. I rang your clubcard helpline and spoke to Sean who was lovely  he re-sent the tickets by email and even waited to make sure the email came through okay. It was nice to speak to someone who wasn t in a hurry to get to the next caller and thanks to Sean we were soon on our way and we had a great day!  We love great customer service and we love Tesco ❤					2016-09-11T22:09:50+0000	1473631790	2016-09-12 00:09:50	3	2	3	0	5	2	1	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

This is the second pack of broccoli I have bought that has been crawling with critters. I know we re supposed to support farmers to use less pesticides. And I should probably just boil it up and be grateful for the extra protein. But my husband is vegetarian and eating caterpillars would disturb him. Instead I have released him to the compost bin where I m sure he and his friends from the rest of the stems will live happily. However I miss broccoli and expect to be able to buy a vegetable without peeling creatures from it.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14344836_1754473878156102_7960896321794403874_n.jpg?oh=178133c362c2936a8733d7d9afaa01ee&oe=58DECF2B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14344836_1754473878156102_7960896321794403874_n.jpg?oh=4e6f4d3f10f0d52d41ce2800fe826887&oe=58DB043E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1754473878156102&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-11T20:49:49+0000	1473626989	2016-09-11 22:49:49	5	6	5	0	11	6	2	4	5	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

I buy these regularly and they are usually 40p. Next to them are sardines in brine or oil at 40p for 120g. So not only has the price increased by more than 100% but the contents have reduced by 25%. I have just checked the asda website and they have chosen by you sardines in tomato sauce at 40p for 120g. As I now have to go to asda for sardines  I will do the rest of my shopping there too. I know prices do have to go up from time to time  but that s ridiculous. Your sardines are now more expensive than your tuna.					2016-09-11T17:44:19+0000	1473615859	2016-09-11 19:44:19	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Fine  perhaps guidance has changed ... but then the recipe on the side of the pack tells me that I should soak the beans overnight.  Back to the cooking instructions – ‘Place the pan on the medium hob ring over a high heat’.  Yep  I have large and small rings although I would love to upgrade to a range type cooker.  Come off it  this is Tesco not Waitrose!!!					2016-09-11T17:42:42+0000	1473615762	2016-09-11 19:42:42	1	8	1	0	9	8	2	6	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought we were friends? I come in every week spend some time with you  and everyone leaves at the end of the visit satisfied.  Today was different  first after completing my shopping using the usually excellent scan as you shop my scanner wouldnt scan the finished shopping thing  to which i was told sorry nothing can be done and that i had to go to a normal check out and have every thing rescanned. Frustrating but ok.   Then the unthinkable happened! Every week I sneak myself a little treat  my new favourite lager Hop house 13 lager from Guiness is part of your 4 for £6 beer range and as my partner tries to decide what beers hes going to try this week I go for my new usual.   As we go through checkout we get to my beers  they dont scan  ok thats fine they didnt scan in the scan and go machine and last week they didnt scan either  so i tell the lady they are part of the 4 for £6 so you can scan my partners beers again or you could do what they did last week and manually add them. The checkout lady called a manager over and told him my suggestion.  He looks at my wonderful beer and at me and says  we cant sell you that beer you have to change it for a different kind.   So please Mr Tesco  why do you have beer on display that im not allowed to buy? Is it to mock me? Do you not like me anymore?  Picture below is of beer on shelf that is aparently not for sale?   Please explain.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14238274_10154597691675086_4994868146593787634_n.jpg?oh=35672188ef1aa7418be0ba6d4a029170&oe=591B0E27	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14238274_10154597691675086_4994868146593787634_n.jpg?oh=a50bc5ea83de2335b7137614837880db&oe=58DDB72A	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154597691675086&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-11T16:54:07+0000	1473612847	2016-09-11 18:54:07	6	5	6	0	11	5	1	4	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

Wow they were delicious 😋   normally I find chicken pies to be a bit bland tasting   but yours were full of flavour and proper pieces of chicken too. 😀					2016-09-11T16:18:37+0000	1473610717	2016-09-11 18:18:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I gave up trying to find turnips and left the store. The security guard followed me for some reason and said that i had something of theirs (Tescos) in my bag.  I had nothing of  Tesco s in my bag   all i had was what i had bought in the charity shop earlier. I pointed this out to him and he left me alone .  Is it possible  Tesco s could check Cctv before accusing innocent shoppers ?  I was left shaken by the experience.					2016-09-11T16:15:35+0000	1473610535	2016-09-11 18:15:35	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Most recently I ve been told by the online customer service team that the St Austell store (from where our online shopping is despatched) is no longer stocking aubergines. Fortunately aubergines  and other items no longer available at Tesco  are stocked at our local Morrison s and Aldi - so when our delivery saver runs out in November we won t be renewing. I really think you are in danger of losing loyal customers. There is no point in having an online delivery if we then have to go and  top up  elsewhere for the items you aren t stocking.					2016-09-11T15:01:55+0000	1473606115	2016-09-11 17:01:55	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Until recently  they stocked a couple of items in the  Free From  ice cream range (they used to only have the choc ices  but for a while they were stocking the strawberry cornetto type).  Now they ve all disappeared  and it s been this way for a couple of weeks.  I was wondering if you could tell me if this is a permanent thing  or if it s just temporary? They do stock the tubs of Swedish Glace dairy free ice cream  but it s a little disheartening to see freezers full of milk based ice cream  and only one choice for us vegans.  The store is in Princess Alice Drive  New Oscott / Sutton Coldfield.  Many thanks  Pete.					2016-09-11T14:10:10+0000	1473603010	2016-09-11 16:10:10	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco Stafford.  you really need to do something about the reduced sections  my daughter (8) and I were casually shopping  the reduced fresh veg/fruit comes out my daughter was pushed twice resulting in her banging her head leaving a red mark  I was pushed and shoved and trolley pulled away just so so called  adults  could get to the items! All we wanted was some strawberries!!  It s shocking how people react over reduced items.  something needs to be done before someone gets seriously hurt!  Also your pot staff member couldn t get out as people were crowding him he had to ask twice for people to move so he could get out!					2016-09-11T13:55:41+0000	1473602141	2016-09-11 15:55:41	1	11	1	0	12	11	4	7	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I hope you will agree that it is an inspirational idea :)   Dear Tesco   I ve noticed recently that you ve started providing free fruit for children while they are shopping with their parents. I think this is a brilliant idea and extremely kind of you. It not only ensures the children get one of their five a day while their parents shop with you  it also in theory keeps them nice and quiet while they re going around the shop. I say in theory. I had no idea just how much of an altercation two children could create over two absolutely identical satsumas until I visited your store last Saturday. I really am very sorry about that.  Anyway  getting to the point  off the back of your free fruit scheme  I have come up with a brilliant marketing idea for you. I am going to share it with you  completely free of charge  because I am really really nice like that.  I wondered if you might consider  alongside your free fruit  providing free alcohol for parents who are shopping with their children.  The benefits of this are several-fold. Firstly  I can guarantee your profits will immediately increase  as everyone will be flocking to shop at Tesco. It will also mean everyone in there is a lot nicer to each other  and will slope around the corner of aisles drunkenly clutching their trolleys giving big drunken hugs to each other  as opposed to hissing  Get that ****ing trolley out of my ****ING way   which is what usually happens in my local branch.  Drunk people are free and easy with their money  so sales will go up dramatically  particularly those of kebab ingredients and condoms. You may even find people circling the store more than once  picking up duplicates of items  due to having drunkenly forgotten that they ve already purchased them  which has surely got to be a marketing dream.  And finally  you can do parents the country over an absolutely enormous favour by providing something to lessen the hell which is supermarket shopping with small children  and I imagine will likely as a result be in line for a flipping knighthood.  When it comes to the type of alcohol you provide  I m prepared to make compromises on my usual drinking choices. One of those miniature bottles of Moet with a little straw would be ideal  but I ll settle for gin in a tin  or hell  even the option of some White Lightning in a paper bag would help to numb the pain.  To help you with your marketing materials  this is me doing Back to School shopping last week. Look at the pain and anguish on my face. This can be your  before  photo  and you can follow it with a picture of me lying in a trolley  a beatific smile on my face  happily clutching my Tesco sponsored free alcohol.  Please have a think and let me know what you think of my amazing plan to help you achieve Greatness. I m sure you will make millions of customers around the country very very happy.  Yours  An Optimistic Tesco Shopper	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14237593_1270235772987290_3126207846474847767_n.jpg?oh=d7e698afc7f0586df8c7a5c2e8d7da7d&oe=58ED2EF8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14237593_1270235772987290_3126207846474847767_n.jpg?oh=288cbc2bb79e882a996eff2e93d3cb68&oe=58D6D8ED	https://www.facebook.com/iknowineedtostoptalkingblog/photos/o.112463368812803/1270235772987290/?type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-11T12:19:27+0000	1473596367	2016-09-11 14:19:27	23	2	27	6	35	1	1	0	0	0	23	0	0	4	0	0	0

The first time  the last space was taken by the car in front and there were no children  just overweight women and the second time I watched 3 separate cars park up with only adults in. At the same time that I watched these selfish individuals take child spaces  I watched 2 other families have to park in the section with the normal small spaces. If you are not going to fine these individuals for abusing the spaces  can you change the layout of your carpark? I need to use the wider spaces to open the car doors to get my children out of their car seats and I would be more than happy to park in the child spaces if they were at the back of your car park. I am more often than not parked at the back of your car park  in the hopes that other people will not park too close. I have also visited another store and found the child spaces were on the outskirts of the car park  this seems a much better lay out. To be honest though  yesterday s experience has put me off shopping at your stores. I m going to spend my money elsewhere in future  but I do hope you will improve your car park and make it more family friendly for other young families.					2016-09-11T11:41:16+0000	1473594076	2016-09-11 13:41:16	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

When/if/ you read your post you could help yourself find the answer (if possible) before consulting Customer Care staff and save time. If I wanted to ie know the opening times of a store in whatever area I need I would type this question and hopefully the answer will be revealed. It s easy when you know what to do and you avoid all that frustration.					2016-09-11T11:30:24+0000	1473593424	2016-09-11 13:30:24	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I pop off to my local tesco to acquire all the staple ingredients needed for a top notch fry up. I wanted to surprise my fiance with breakfast in bed.   The eggs were popping away in the pan  the sausages were a lovely golden colour and the toast was buttered - so far so good.  Upon opening the bacon  mouth watering  longing thoughts for the Smokey smell  my face turned white once I looked at the use by date.   How was I supposed to serve my fiance a full English without the bacon? HOW?   Bacon is arguably the most important part of the full English breakfast  and it felt sacrilegious serving the love of my life a breakfast without bacon.   The morning was ruined  and I was close to performing a cleansing ritual on myself because I felt so disappointed.  My fiance almost left me.  Please help save my engagement and rectify this tragedy.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14322701_10154474187302354_1492580904474599477_n.jpg?oh=cfe2029f4f224678ef31c57fca00d5c4&oe=591B9011	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14322701_10154474187302354_1492580904474599477_n.jpg?oh=213c36c8f244c24589d2d68c7b5e87ee&oe=591AC21C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154474187302354&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-11T11:21:15+0000	1473592875	2016-09-11 13:21:15	13	11	14	1	26	10	4	6	4	0	13	1	0	0	0	0	0

I had to write this morning to say what an AWESOME company you are. I m only out of hospital after a back procedure  and very sore  so any kind of lifting is out  never mind a family shop for lots of pets with heavy food and liter etc. I never knew you guys did an online delivery service until a friend suggested it. Not only did I get everything I needed delivered to my door in less 24 hours  but you had everything I usually buy all ready for me to chose again on the page  so it was completely hassle free. It s made my life a LOT easier this week I can tell you  and your delivery gentleman John  was an absolute pleasure to deal with! Thank you so much for providing this service  it must be such an ease to the elderly  sick  disabled or very busy people! An absolute breeze to do! Will recommend you guys to everyone and will be getting this for my grandmother too! Thanks again!					2016-09-11T10:36:44+0000	1473590204	2016-09-11 12:36:44	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

After speaking with your tech support team it was organised that my sons hudl 2 would be sent back to them for repair after a software update left it unusable. This was a lovely gesture on your part as its out of warranty and you fixed it free of charge for which I am grateful and I thank you. But..... And here s the surprising but.... Though you have rectified the software problem and sent it back to us looking shiny and new it now doesn t charge  I mean at all!!! The charger gets plugged in (and we ve tried three chargers) and nothing happens. We discovered this last night when we tried to charge it for the first time since it came back to us last Tuesday (06/09/2016)!! I ve called and spoken to a nice man at your Tech helpline today only to be told that you won t fix it again  even though it s come back to us this way!! You ve said we MAY be eligible for a partial refund of the item at today s value (which lets be honest will be nothing as it was bought almost two years ago and you no longer sell the hudl 2). I just hoped you would take responsibility for this error and fix the problem you created so that my 5 year old can play with his tablet again. Surely this is a reasonable request?!? We get to have a five year old with a working tablet and you get to keep your money and our custom.					2016-09-11T10:12:51+0000	1473588771	2016-09-11 12:12:51	3	3	3	0	6	3	2	1	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Both of these instances were witnessed by one of your members of staff which my husband asked to help enforce this rule and was reluctant to do anything . This is what I would call bad customer service. Even if it is not his job to police the car park   surely if he is in a uniform representing your company we should get more than a few grumbles from him .   Angered from what I saw ( a mixture of people parking there without children and how this effects other mums ability to shop in your store . Without these spaces we cannot get children in and out of the car .. It s not possible ) as well as your staffs inability to do anything to help I shared this experience with a group called Babies Babies Babies and to my dismay the response I got sharing other similar stories in your carparks across the country came forward .   In fact some of these stories were worse with customers seeing your own staff park in these spaces without any children.   Tescos was dubbed the worst for instances with these spaces .   I am therefore writing because all these stories are ridiculous. Your rules aren t being reinforced and parents with young babies are paying the price.   I would like to know what you are going to be doing to fix this issue .   An idea I had was that if you parked in this space you would have to register your license plate with customer service so they could see you had a baby and actually needed the space .   I look forward to hearing from you soon .					2016-09-11T08:07:07+0000	1473581227	2016-09-11 10:07:07	0	6	0	0	6	5	3	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I gave up shortly after. The reason I used your online service is because I gave birth a week ago and currently I m finding it difficult to get to the shops. I also have a two year told daughter who this morning only has one spare nappy as this was apart of my shop  my husband is currently driving around on a Sunday morning trying to find somewhere open to get her nappies. I can t believe not even so much as a phone to advise that my shop would not arrive. My order number is 21035581. Can you please advise me what happen and ensure me that you will not be taking any money from my account for a shop I have not received.					2016-09-11T06:54:15+0000	1473576855	2016-09-11 08:54:15	0	10	0	0	10	10	5	5	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They deserved a medal. But whilst I went to self service 4 of your staff was so of there staring and suggesting they give that child a good old whack   and said  that would never have happened to us  I couldn t believe what I heard... I was fuming because as having a child with issues himself I don t think you realise how hard it is. And obviously  whacking  a child does not sort nothing in this day and age. Your staff need to know when to keep their opinions to themselves! The parents had to walk out and leave their shop. And had s screaming child all the way home ( cause I passed them) hats of to them for being strong and not giving in!!					2016-09-11T06:47:09+0000	1473576429	2016-09-11 08:47:09	11	16	15	0	31	15	5	10	11	0	11	0	0	0	0	3	0

Scanned the end of trip barcode on the checkout to have my shop loaded into the till  then went to payment and redeemed/inserted a bunch of close-to-expiry Clubcard vouchers I needed to use up or lose.  It was only then that I noticed the checkout I was using didn t have a [Cash] option on the payment screen  and it became apparent to me the checkout was operating in cashless mode. I paid the balance by card instead  but this was a minor inconvenience given that for once in my life I was in possession of just the right amount of change! :-D :-p    Could the SAYS till software please be revised to make supported and unavailable payment options visible and clear to the customer at a point *before* they scan the EoT barcode  please? With classic self-scan this is less of a problem as I can easily carry my goods over to another checkout if I see the one I m about to use displaying a [Start Cards Only] button  but as SAYS downloads the cart from the scanner to the till and then resets the scanner this is considerably more difficult to do on a SAYS checkout without requiring staff assistance.   I d suggest having an info-strip along the top of the screen (Like those displayed by credit card terminals) showing payment options accepted  with a visible cross over those which are temporarily unavailable. This is more likely to be noticed by customers whilst aiming their scanners at the EoT barcode on the top of the monitor. :-)    Many thanks for your consideration! 8-)					2016-09-11T00:05:27+0000	1473552327	2016-09-11 02:05:27	0	8	0	0	8	8	4	4	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I parked my car on tesco car park for a couple of hours. (between 11.30 and 3-30) while I was parked there on the right as you enter the car park some arrogant person decided to hit my car and just drive off. As you can imagine I am furious and keen to get the registration number if anybody saw anything I would be grateful for any little detail you may have. Thank you 😄					2016-09-10T23:44:23+0000	1473551063	2016-09-11 01:44:23	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Me and my Partner have used the scan as you shop a few times now and each time we have to under go a random  security  check!  I understand that as a store you have a right to do this  but we have used it 7 times now and each time we have had these checks.  When I said something to a lady in store about this she said it was because we are only 20 and they do this to all young people. I don t feel this is acceptable from a company to discriminate against us because of our age!!  We also have under gone comments from other customers like  oh look the young ones are stealing again   oh they must have no shame sealing like that   I must stress that I suffer really bad from depression and anxiety and the scan as you shop was brilliant for me to help reduce my anxiety levels  how ever this is not the case.   I must also stress we have never used a Tesco since the incident with the lady confirming that Tesco discriminate against young people.  I also plan on never using a Tesco again and have moved to another super market.   Hope to hear from you soon. Mr K Silkstone.					2016-09-10T23:38:33+0000	1473550713	2016-09-11 01:38:33	1	12	1	0	13	6	2	4	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As much as I love your stores  what I am really really not enjoying is being sat here in my car waiting to get petrol.  I ve been at work all day and the last thing I need is to sit and wait from 2343 till 0030 before having to drive home.  Your petrol station clearly states 24hour.  I understand needing to change over or cash up but nearly an hour really.					2016-09-10T23:12:34+0000	1473549154	2016-09-11 01:12:34	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered a breakfast and 2 children s fish fingers and chips at 11:58  told fish fingers were on afternoon menu. Explained OK  I ll order separately  Ordered breakfast waited 2 minutes then ordered children s meals. Told children s meals would be 25 minutes. Didn t want children to wait so said just two beans on toast instead. Told that was breakfast menu that ended at 12 (2 minutes ago when the breakfast was ordered) Very frustrated I asked for all the food to come at once when the children s meals were ready. Was told OK. Breakfast came out 15 minutes later  children s meals took another 15 minutes  Couldn t eat the breakfast in front of them  so had to let it go cold. Asked to see a manager and was told that no manager was in. I returned 4 days later and again no manager on site  I spoke to the store duty manager who took my details and said he would pass details on for a call back. (I watched him enter cafe and give info to counter staff) it s been another 4 days and I ve still herd nothing. Starting to think the extra in the store name means extra hassle. I will never go to either the cafe or supermarket again and will tell everyone that is interested about the poor attitude and service of TESCO  ASDA can have my business from now on.					2016-09-10T22:25:25+0000	1473546325	2016-09-11 00:25:25	0	17	0	0	17	17	4	13	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was nose to nose to me  swearing and telling me he was  going to teach me some manners   Security guard did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  as did staff who actually served the man.  Is this the quality of staff we can expect from Tescos? Where customers safety is in jeopardy because of inadequate staff  and an apathetic attitude?					2016-09-10T22:18:39+0000	1473545919	2016-09-11 00:18:39	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She was wonderful  my 4 yr old son was having a meltdown moment...I think everyone could hear him. However  just wanted to say how amazing she was with both of us in the end. Just her kindness set me off crying...I had a sarcasstic remark from one customer  then there were a couple of supportive customers  which first started me of crying. I m sorry I don t know her name  because she should be awarded in her way for her compassion for her customers...even the manic  crazy  looking ones. I hope she can recognise this incident and know it s her I speak of. I was I  a rush for work and thing were not kept to my sons usual place...hence the meltdown but she was uderstanding  and I wish she gets some credit for this because she more than deserved it that day. P.S in love your free from section but can you please supply the gluten Breadsticks without milk/dairy (my son has many allergies) Much love to you all. Thanks for making my experience when shopping with a toddler in my own an easier one.  I have been given grieve from a certain super market about my child sitting in the trolley basket (I refuse to reutrn to this store after been attacked by an employer about it) which never seems to bother you. Thankyou..Thankyou.  Emma Widdowson					2016-09-10T22:09:48+0000	1473545388	2016-09-11 00:09:48	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in the Reading store on Napier Road this evening  just before 8pm. My boyfriend and I were walking down the entrance isle of the store when he decided it would be a good idea to  let the trolley do the work  (in his words). Being 6ft4   and almost 100kg  he soon realised this was not a smart idea when he found himself face down on the floor with the trolley flipped on its side skidding towards the wine and beer display. He told me after that he  couldn t control the trolley s acceleration  so had to let it go and accept his fate of falling flat in the middle of the store. We were approached by many of your helpful staff to ensure he was okay but as you can imagine I was I was crying and unable to talk from laughter as he embarrassingly apologised to those around us. After we had calmed ourselves we noticed there was a cctv camera which would have caught the whole thing....  it in anyway possible that we would be allowed access to these few humiliating moments??					2016-09-10T21:58:06+0000	1473544686	2016-09-10 23:58:06	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was shopping alone with my 2 daughters  the youngest of which has additional needs. Shopping trips with her can be hugely challenging and stressful with her having to be contained in the trolley but often trying to escape. Paula firstly helped us hugely by offering to assist us in removing the packaging from a toy purchased (birthday present) so that she could play with it  but then invited her around to help in scanning the shopping. The delight in my daughter s face is captured perfectly on the photo - Paula totally engaged her  made it fun  and was not phased by the queue starting to build up (or the supervisors watching the development 😃). She was amazing in her attitude  helpfulness and understanding  and certainly helped make our shopping experience less stressful and a memorable one. My daughter will be wanting to see Paula on every visit now! All stores should have a  Paula ! Please ensure this post is shared with Paula and pass on my gratitude for her support and thoughtfulness today - she is a star!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14330102_10155099359319041_5686820826882384058_n.jpg?oh=92ed00f17ee22fd5e07a1e4776ff2faa&oe=591E6A0F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14330102_10155099359319041_5686820826882384058_n.jpg?oh=d88951a1154758d48bb3cc8cbfa95eba&oe=58E5A202	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155099359319041&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-10T21:09:36+0000	1473541776	2016-09-10 23:09:36	3407	195	3759	680	4634	192	164	28	722	0	3381	341	3	4	0	0	0

We asked the fishmonger for some advice around which ones we can eat as we thought you couldn t eat the ones that didn t open. He assured us that (in not the best English)  its all ok  no problem.  Thank God we have subsequently Googled it to find out you have to firstly make sure they all close if open already and then discard any that don t open after the cooking process. The guy on the counter clearly had no idea what he was talking about and shouldn t have been on there (we also asked about portion sizes to be given no real answer.) Tesco - I feel let down on this occasion and there is clearly a training/staffing issue that needs to be addressed in this store. I would like to be given  a reason why I would return to your store when  had I followed the advice of your employee  I would have put my self and girlfriend at risk of food poisoning. I look forward to hearing back (the visit was at about 14.45)					2016-09-10T20:13:23+0000	1473538403	2016-09-10 22:13:23	1	6	1	0	7	6	2	4	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This was after checking through about 10 packets of peaches as a lot of them seemed to be sweaty and mouldy. Finally find some that seem okay to be disappointed because the mould was just hidden at the bottom of the packet!   Please sort it out as you guys are kind of responsible for my white flesh peach addiction 😂					2016-09-10T18:19:22+0000	1473531562	2016-09-10 20:19:22	1	4	1	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

This lady was amazing I think her name was Carol on till 6. She came and helped me unload my trolley then the young girl on till 5 came and took over so Carol could start to scan and pack for me while I tried to distract and calm Leah. These 2 amazing ladies got me through the till and packed really fast they were so helpful made a very stressful situation less stressful I can t thank you enough please get this to them xx					2016-09-10T18:16:34+0000	1473531394	2016-09-10 20:16:34	408	29	430	25	484	29	18	11	20	0	404	22	0	0	0	0	0

Tropicana Red Berry. Got it home and had a glass and thought it not tasting very much of red berries. I looked at the ingredients and seen why!  Water  and apple juice make up 35%.  I never knew apple to be a berry. Raspberry puree  yes that s red but very little. Blueberry puree  not red. Elderberry juice and grape juice. This is so misleading to call red berry   what about strawberry? that s a red berry. This product was not cheap. £2.58. It certainly pays to read the small print but why trick your customers Tesco.?

They say they venresearched nationwide  and the answer is to give us less choice . I say  if that s what you want then go to ALDI. That s their latest excuse for removing products then saying they ll reorder them  then changing their tune again. West Bromwich Extra- it s you I m annoyed with! Smaller Tescos stock more of what I want- eg Dudley and Princess Park. And you can spit managers on the shop floor there. WB ones have a cloak of invisibility or they have to be in meetings when you want to complain. To do this  join the queue which is for customer service  tobacco  lottery  stamps etc- so prepare to waste half an hour then be told the manager is in a meeting. Rubbish customer care from managers  leaving staff to feed off complaints.					2016-09-10T15:38:42+0000	1473521922	2016-09-10 17:38:42	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We always shop with you and are loyal customers and have just had a phone call to say that they can not deliver my shopping tonight (7-8pm) as two drivers are off sick. Firstly this isn t my problem and surely they can find alternate drivers to cover?  The man on the phone offered to either have my shopping in the next hour (which is not possible as we are at a family gathering) or come and collect my shopping from store later on today!  Reluctantly I chose the second option and I now have to go out of my way to collect it and use my own petrol to get there. The reason we get it delivered is so we don t have to take it up the stairs to our top floor flat so I ve now got to lug it all in my car and then all the way up the stairs into our flat. I have had no offer of reimbursement for anything  not even the delivery! Really not impressed and I will  be making this very clear to customer service when I collect my shopping today. Very tempted to consider using online shopping elsewhere.					2016-09-10T14:54:28+0000	1473519268	2016-09-10 16:54:28	0	9	0	0	9	9	4	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ve done my online shopping and weren t impressed with the delivery part. You have a new flexi system in which I don t like. I have to wait in longer for it unlike the hour before. But if I want to use the hour slot like I am use to its double the price. Friday slots are usually £4 plus and so I moved to Wednesday slots as they are £1. I have to wait in longer now to use the £1 slots which you advertised so well that you have slots for a £1 but they are either on the Wednesday or late evening. If I want my normal hour slot I have to pay double with I think isn t fair I spend over £100 and I don t have a good size car with a baby in tow to do it my self. Until my new car comes I am stuck with this or I shop elsewhere as you re old system was just fine the way it was. Granted some deliveries were early or late but haven t complained.					2016-09-10T14:47:00+0000	1473518820	2016-09-10 16:47:00	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But craving for a doughnut I bought more  Mistake sauce still venegary. the rest being a little dry. Well in the bin they go  went to Morrisons and they really must make the best apple doughnuts on the planet. soft dough and tangy filling. Its a pain to have to drive miles to get my fix  Yet your value apple pies are the best apples pies not to much pastry and nice tangy filling.					2016-09-10T14:27:48+0000	1473517668	2016-09-10 16:27:48	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I am sure you are aware advertising  reducing the price of or promoting infant formula (suitable from birth) is actually illegal. Please could you speak to the in-store staff to explain the legality of this and ask that they remove it from sale? Thanks.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14212757_10153743146367791_4824814779452277835_n.jpg?oh=b940e7077504050449935cbd07d5b9fe&oe=58D9B1D1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14212757_10153743146367791_4824814779452277835_n.jpg?oh=032448c979f23ea6a6d2d31e8251caf7&oe=591BD0DC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153743146367791&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-10T14:05:41+0000	1473516341	2016-09-10 16:05:41	12	27	22	2	51	27	6	21	94	0	12	0	1	0	0	9	0

The reason I ask is I have regularly bought 3 2 pint cartons each week & never had to throw any away. For the last few weeks  when I ve come to the last carton  I ve had to throw at least half away as it has gone lumpy  despite having several days life based on the  use by  date. It doesn t smell off but if I add some to my coffee  for example  it all sinks to the bottom.  I m currently on my last carton from a delivery I received last Sunday &  despite only having opened it yesterday morning & it having a  use by  date of 13th September  it s already starting to turn.  Does your supplier have some sort of quality control problem?					2016-09-10T13:20:55+0000	1473513655	2016-09-10 15:20:55	0	5	0	0	5	5	1	4	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Dear Morrison s   After 6 1/2 years of loyal service my Tesco microwave went to electrical goods heaven. A short service was had followed by an emotional trip to the tip.   This morning I felt ready to embrace the relationship with a new microwave. I was in your Southend store shopping and spotted at the reasonable price of £40.   After purchasing said microwave I headed home to fill the void left by my Tesco one. After opening the box I was dismayed to find that the lead supplied did not reach to the plug socket. A mere 15cm stood between me and microwave heaven.   After nearly ripping out my entire kitchen and starting over   I came to the conclusion that an extension lead would suffice for now.   At last I have a working microwave but I am disappointed that Morrison s are cutting corners   or in this case cables to cut costs.

My 1 year old was in her stroller and 2 year old on her reins. Something must have caught my 2 year old eyes and within 10 minutes of being in the store her reins slipped out my hand and she ran.... My heart sank and within seconds she was out of my sight! I called out for her and there was no answer. Dashing around looking for her on my own wasn t working so I alerted a member of staff. All staff involved acted so fast and before I knew it there were so many staff looking for my daughter. What seemed like forever was probably about 5 minutes but they found her 😃 At this point I m in tears and still feel sick. But the staff were there for me and both my daughters. I would like to thank each and every one of you for ending a parents worst nightmare. A special mention has to go to a man named Paul who went the extra mile to help with my shopping at the checkout whilst giving the girls sweets and making them smile. He then carried my shopping to the car! Amazing customer service and being a dad to 4 himself he knew what I was going through. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH from a very happy tesco customer. ☺					2016-09-10T12:34:55+0000	1473510895	2016-09-10 14:34:55	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I thought I had become well accustomed to some of your product peccadilloes and foibles (such as cream being foisted from its rightful place among the dairy and milk products)   but this morning my ghast was utterly and completely flabbered by an impromptu and increasingly frantic search for tinned tomatoes.  I must admit that this may be down to hubris on my part; there may have been a little self assured smugness as I entered the store  confidently telling myself that I had the matter well in hand - my quarry would be safely tucked alongside the baked beans and other tinned vegetables.  Imagine the Bean-esque dumbfounded expression that settled on my face when I arrived at that particular destination to find that no  there were no tinned tomatoes there!! Up and down the aisle I paced  at an increasingly slowed pace. It seemed obvious that I just couldn t see them. Alas  this was not the case. Remembering the cream stocking policy  I tried to apply the same warped logic.   THAT S IT!  I thought  they ve stocked them round by the pasta sauces! . I jubilantly strode into the next aisle only to be presented with a complete re-run of the previous scene in its entirety. I was now beginning to doubt my own mental competence as I looped the two aisles over and over  stooped to varying heights with each pass; this is surely the early onset of some kind of dementia I convinced myself.  Tomato blindness is obviously just the first in a devastating and degenerative array of symptoms that were now queuing up to beset me. Just to confirm this I had to prove that there were no tinned tomatoes present elsewhere in the store   after all   where else could they possibly be?  A few aisles across and my jaw dropped to the floor (or  for the sake of accuracy   just above the floor about level with the display of cooking salt in various packages).  I HAD FOUND THE TINNED TOMATOES!!  It turned out that  in their wisdom   Tesco have now stocked their tinned tomatoes   puree etc. in a new and convenient food category entitled  Tomatoes And Pulses . TOMATOES AND PULSES!!?  WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!? Why stop there?  Why not  Strawberries And Toilet Duck    Cabbages and Stationery  or even  Sausages And Birth Control ?  Please at least try and exercise some common sense in your store policies!					2016-09-10T12:24:56+0000	1473510296	2016-09-10 14:24:56	65	34	107	14	155	34	25	9	51	0	64	3	0	39	0	0	0

Before people reply with saying  you should watch your child   I was watching him and all I did was turn for a 2nd to put my other child in the trolley. My son was very distressed and took me nearly half an hour to calm him down! I m disgusted in tesco for not replying to my email. I shop at tesco all the time!					2016-09-10T12:13:21+0000	1473509601	2016-09-10 14:13:21	0	19	0	0	19	19	2	17	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Previous to the current store changes there were two freezers of vegetarian products. This is the current state of the vegetarian freezer in Selby Tesco. I was disappointed that meat products from the  free from  range were mixed in with the vegetarian products. Many of my favourite vegetarian frozen products were also not available. I would like to see the previous range resorted and meat products removed from the vegetarian section.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14225410_864657953671486_107235676153684073_n.jpg?oh=03e40e7c7a078548efafcbba1f15c997&oe=58E8F103	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14225410_864657953671486_107235676153684073_n.jpg?oh=4f517a4592c156deecfda0b2e2c7eb2e&oe=58EB7EF4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=864657953671486&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-10T10:23:48+0000	1473503028	2016-09-10 12:23:48	2	12	2	2	16	10	7	3	18	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have enclosed several pictures of a recent purchase I made from yourselves of a packet of replacement car bulbs. At first I though all was well  until I noticed the light did not last very long so I went to investigate the problem and to my dismay I have found the following problem. A broken light bulb that has melted to the side of the light connector resulting in the fact that I m not able to simply replace the bulb but indeed the whole light and connector. This is not a simple procedure. The main issue I have with this is that I have my MOT Tuesday 13th of September and due to the faulty light I know I will fail the mot test. I work 12 hour shifts and as such I cannot replace the faulty light before then as I am working between now and then. Further more for me to pass the car through the mot test I will have to pay a substantial amount more to replace the whole fitting as dealership costs are considerably more than a local garage would charge but I always have all of my car services and mot s carried out in my local Nissan dealership to guarantee genuine parts etc Thai couples with the fact that I m working so I don t have the time to get to a garage to replace the whole thing.  I sincerely hope that you can help me in this situation as I have bought a product from Tesco that subsequently will end up costing me quite a bit more in replacement fees!  Yours hopefully   Lee Phillips					2016-09-10T09:59:24+0000	1473501564	2016-09-10 11:59:24	0	6	0	0	6	6	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

These were purchased late Thursday afternoon  & they were rotten by the next day. I know fruit can go off quickly  but if I knew they were going to go off so quickly  I would of saved some money & bought them cheaper at the market. I know to some £2 isn t a lot  but were on a budget  & I would of thought they would last slightly longer as they came from a supermarket. Every penny counts for us. Its hard to buy a range of delicious fruits on a budget  I can see why families opt for cheap value biscuits  as they re half the price & last longer. I now have a disappointed son as he wanted these for breakfast.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14330041_10157420220795704_889324132532173805_n.jpg?oh=df0d274529993b8c0517e8fe170e12cf&oe=59196525	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14330041_10157420220795704_889324132532173805_n.jpg?oh=32bc7eabd3b72013918ec1e2717a0426&oe=58E6E630	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157420220795704&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-10T09:45:20+0000	1473500720	2016-09-10 11:45:20	0	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0

The problem I m having is I purchased a cooker online with an electric cooker connection  the engineer couldn t fit it which was fine I didn t have a problem with that  I rang up to say they hadn t fitted it and was promised a refund in 3-5 working days. Fine no problem 5 days later I ring back to ask why I hadn t received my refund and was told it hadn t been authorised by a Team Support! So at this point I m annoyed but accept the fact I have to wait another 3-5 working days to receive my refund. At this point I m angry but OK   however I then receive an email to say that my refund is due and I m receiving £53.95... when I payed £59.95  now my blood is boiling I phone back a third time... THIRD time?!? This is ridiculous to speak to Colin who resolved my problem  Colin was brilliant I commend him however I m severely annoyed at the lack of skills your previous employees have for dealing with me! Utterly unimpressed.					2016-09-10T09:31:42+0000	1473499902	2016-09-10 11:31:42	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So I thought nothing of her raiding the fridge and grabbing the punnet of raspberries.  She rinsed them under the tap and started munching away. She was most concerned when she found this little guy in the raspberry she was about to pop into her mouth. However   she is even more distraught by the fact that i chucked the remaining raspberries in the bin!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14232991_10154501366087328_3254311633465397882_n.jpg?oh=dc4b2a4753fa31f3dae7354bb3be09cd&oe=58DCD860	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14232991_10154501366087328_3254311633465397882_n.jpg?oh=dcc39b96e48d925803870e94b6b47bb1&oe=58DD5B6D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154501366087328&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-10T09:22:43+0000	1473499363	2016-09-10 11:22:43	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Since that time we have been in contact with you three times and each time have been told it has been processed or asked once again where to send it to.

By the time we realised we had left him we were already home 2 hours away. I have one very happy little boy. 😄	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14264855_10153655600791673_692662534925404037_n.jpg?oh=3877b640d8cba1645163aebe9a1ceead&oe=591DA0F1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14264855_10153655600791673_692662534925404037_n.jpg?oh=c1b98786bf212f396e25d6c6f1c9823d&oe=58DEE6E4	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153655600791673&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-10T09:07:07+0000	1473498427	2016-09-10 11:07:07	19	3	20	0	23	2	2	0	1	0	17	1	0	0	0	0	0

I understand that the food and drink for the deal are supplied  as one   but please please please don t chill the red wine. Especially at Express stores  where this seems to be a particular oversight  such meals are often bought for immediate consumption  and short of sticking the Malbec into the microwave to warm it up from near freezing  what is one to do..? Have mentioned it to store staff a few times but just get blank looks  so obviously needs some guidance from higher up!					2016-09-10T08:41:46+0000	1473496906	2016-09-10 10:41:46	0	6	0	0	6	5	1	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I put it in the wash this morning on a 40 degree wash inside out  as instructed on the label.  Just took it out to hang it up and it s almost falling apart and become almost shrunken and quite stringy rather than the nice soft thick wool effect it had. I m trying to find out if I can get my money back as it will be unwearable even if I can fix the holes and if the washing instructions are incorrect? Everything else in this load of washing was fine  this was the only item that appeared damaged so I m thinking it isn t a problem with my washing machine. Thank you.					2016-09-10T08:10:20+0000	1473495020	2016-09-10 10:10:20	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The bread in question which I bought the day before was of course Tesco s  finest  white cob loaf found on the regular bread isle. I didn t think I had to check the best before date before buying as I was planning to use the said loaf for sandwiches the next morning. Well was I wrong  after finding the mould I checked the best before date and it was 8/9/16 which was the day I bought the loaf! Given the amount of mould I would say the mould didn t happen overnight and was mouldy when I bought it. Feeling rather disgusted and wondering how many people bought a loaf from the same shelf and ate Tesco s  finest  mouldy bread..					2016-09-10T05:21:59+0000	1473484919	2016-09-10 07:21:59	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Have you tried putting £116 worth of shopping through a self service till? Yeah I think you can imagine what it was like  Fuming wasnt the word. So we managed to put the shopping through to then get my privilege card out for it to say staff discount not aloud...asked the same member of staff to please help his name was Ekram to try my card again and again which didn t change anything for him to then just shrug his shoulders at us and go help somebody else and ignore us so i said is there nothing you can do? Do I not get my discount then? for him to reply  Erm no sorry  and just walked away!! Absolutely disgusted with the whole experience and customer service I received and I work for One stop stores who are part of tesco so Iam even more annoyed as being a customer and  part of the tesco family I feel really let down as I would never have treated a customer like that at all especially if they spent nearly £120. He could see we was struggling and didn t seem bothered or interested and to not give me my discount which worked out at £11 which Iam entitled to just left me feeling stupid and embarrassed the way he handled it and to not shout a manager over or someone who could help....I will be contacting customer services tomorrow to make a complaint about this person to say he is representing tesco I would not want him working for me  no people skills at all and to dismiss us and help someone else in the middle of helping us and then come back to his post and just stand there and pretend we wasn t there was shocking. Anyway I expect a reply and some kind of apology and I will not be returning to that store again.					2016-09-09T22:42:12+0000	1473460932	2016-09-10 00:42:12	0	7	0	0	7	7	3	4	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I came to shop just before 5pm with my two children and was greeted by a lady doing an Oreo s promotion.  She told my children to buy some Oreo s and they would get a gift bag with new Oreo flavours to try.  We went and purchased some regular Oreo s and the kids were quite excited about it.  Now this is a little thing  but to my kids it meant the world.  So we went shopping for roughly ten minutes and came back to where the lady was only to find she had packed up and left!  Why on earth would she not have the common decency to tell us if she was about to finish or go on a break?  Why did she feel it was OK to let two children down over something so trivial?  I wouldn t be so offended and upset had she explained she was due to finish  but she didn t and as such I left with two upset and angry children.  Thanks VERY much!					2016-09-09T21:56:55+0000	1473458215	2016-09-09 23:56:55	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Whilst we didn t want a fuss  just a check that we were OK would have been reassuring. He wasn t being naughty  he lives with a chronic condition. He has now been admitted to hospital. I don t think we will be shopping at Tesco in future.					2016-09-09T21:54:11+0000	1473458051	2016-09-09 23:54:11	0	8	1	0	9	6	3	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

Whilst chatting I learnt he was working an hour and a half overtime because a van had broken down. I asked if he d be paid extra for this and he said that the night time extra pay has been dropped so he won t be getting anything. How sad is this! A massive company like Tesco must be able to afford that. I will be transferring my weekly shop to somewhere that treats its staff better.					2016-09-09T21:48:32+0000	1473457712	2016-09-09 23:48:32	0	3	0	0	3	3	3	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You may remember me from such incidents as the Great Doughnut Con of 2015?  Last year I wrote to you with a dilemma  after I had bought some doughnuts  due to having a craving for some jammy doughnut goodness.  Unfortunately  those crazy little custard filled horrors cleverly disguised themselves as jam doughnuts  packaging and all and it left me with a rather lacklustre evening as a result. Well guess what  I m back!! 😎 This time I want to complain about the charcoal cleverly disguised as chicken (see picture). Now don t get me wrong  I like a bargain. In fact I m a pretty tight fisted person and usually have a resident moth or two in my wallet at all time for good measure  so 40p is hardly a huge some of cash. But yet again my evening  which was beginning to resemble a very shiny fully inflated smily face ballon (🙂)  is now nothing but a massive pile of disappointment 💩. Having had a pretty busy week at work  and a pretty hectic day (for once)  I left work feeling upbeat and happy.  I went home  via Wilkos (I love that store) and bought some bird seed and nuts for the local garden dwelling birds and squirrels  feeling that I had to do my bit for the wildlife. Having got home  I proceeded to feed my feathered friends and then I walked my dog. I then drove my wife in to the City centre for her night out  came home and cleaned the car. I then proceeded to do some housework so the weekend would be free. Normally after a hectic day and busy evening I would call La Piazza and order a pepperoni and salami pizza  once I had convinced myself to part with £4.90 (you should try them. Amazing pizza s at bargain prices 🍕) However as time was ticking  and it was approaching 9pm I decided £4.90 was too precious to me  and as I am tighter than Robin Hood s tights  I decided to walk to the local Tesco rather than drive  so I could save on fuel  and also get the step count up on my wife s Fitbit after her pitiful day time effort at walking!! Having got to Tesco in around 8 minutes  I had a wander around looking for offers and anything I could have for tea in the £1 range. As I approached the hot counter I saw 4 bags left on the shelf. As I got closer  my eyes caught sight of the reduced sticker. I approached with eagerness and to my amazement each bag had been reduced from £2 to 20p!! I quickly looked around for any fellow bargain hunters but it was just me. As I went to grab two of the bags  I hesitated and the voice in my head said  wait. Do you even like hot and spicy chicken thighs?  🤔. I argued with myself for a minute  I even thought about that pizza  but I saw the light  I knew dinner would only cost me 40p. I took the bags and raced to the checkout  stopping to get some Dr Pepper along the way. I got to the checkout and was served by a less than enthusiastic man  who s name I don t remember. I paid for my items  the moths in my wallet danced  and I raced home  which took slightly longer as it was uphill 😥. I got home  sat down and sent a snapchat of my bargains to my wife. I opened the bags  reached in and I pulled out what I thought was a chicken thigh.  Upon inspection it appeared to be a small lump of charcoal. I emptied the bag. Yet more charcoal. I opened the second bag  another piece of charcoal. I emptied that bag  and even more charcoal.   How could this be  I said to myself. My smile disappeared  I started to feel a huge sense of disappointment 😞.  Not again  I said. I again read the label on each bag  Hot and Spicy Chicken Thighs. NOW 20p . I again looked at the items from the bags. There was a sense of denial.  Please Tesco  please tell me you are not this cruel  I said  before I finally realised they were rather overdone  and slightly charred chicken wings.  By now I was starting to feel like a tin can in a recycling plant  crushed!! My evening ruined  nothing to eat  close to 9:30pm and with no desire left to eat or even contemplate a pizza to make up for the huge disappointment. I toyed with the idea of having a bowl of nestle clusters and a cinnamon flavoured pop tart  but that idea is still yet to become reality! I now feel devastated that another evening has been reduced to wondering what could have been!! I know you get what you pay for sometimes  I m not even after a refund  (but I would settle for Starbar if you have any 😋). But to be conned by your local supermarket again is pretty soul destroying  especially when dinner is involved.  I just ask that a bit of care  love and attention is given to packaging your bargains in future  as I would hate this to happen to someone else.  On the plus side  I am planning on having a bbq this weekend  so I may save those charred wings to help get it started.   Kind Regards  Mike 😢.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14232523_10154516508021913_6797140072128068948_n.jpg?oh=350f174ff9b9b02d6ca647e974c1be7a&oe=58E8E03B	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14232523_10154516508021913_6797140072128068948_n.jpg?oh=23a2292137fa2de5423c99b5364e8cf8&oe=58E2D936	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154516508021913&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-09T21:44:23+0000	1473457463	2016-09-09 23:44:23	34	16	41	7	64	15	12	3	10	0	34	0	0	7	0	0	0

As a lover of all foods fine  I do like to purchase these delicious gourmet delights.  I have recently noticed though that the quality has somewhat gone downhill.  After cooking for the recommended 25 minutes  they are still completely raw  so I duly cook for a further 20 mins.  The ex sea faring little dude is very well cooked.  The pastry however  resembles a soggy  anaemic  piece of paper.  This sorry state of affairs has impacted on our dining experience for the 3rd time today  so I felt it was time to bring it to your attention.  I don t know what the captain would say  but I fear it may be man overboard for the Tesco chef.  Please have a word or I may have to walk the plank to find another supplier of this favourite dish of ours.  Thanking you in anticipation of a crispier future dining experience.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14238276_10209020929453760_1244335308913947358_n.jpg?oh=fd70b9cb43f4d3dc22fc77988fb3dae6&oe=59242EAD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14238276_10209020929453760_1244335308913947358_n.jpg?oh=a1d5df2e471ea19c0f614a210338c987&oe=58DBEEA0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209020929453760&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-09T21:03:27+0000	1473455007	2016-09-09 23:03:27	0	5	0	0	5	5	3	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As I use it in my cooking  I don t need it to be fantastic  though I still appreciate an actual taste of honey! which leads me to my complaint.   I decided to try 2 different jars - your Everyday Value and  the next one up  that you sell  Tesco Clear Honey  Both state that they contain a blend of EU and non-EU honeys.   Without any actual evidence to back up my taste buds  I can t say with absolute certainty that the  Value  is more golden syrup than Honey  but they sure try to tell me this! It does not even smell of Honey. Your  Clear Honey  did have a smell of the actual product and some flavour  but not 100%  This issue has previously been highlighted by news programmes  aired on one of the main channels  so I know I m not out with the fairies. The conclusion was  after analysing several brands (not saying Tesco was one of them) that many many many of them claiming to be honey  were in fact blended  to varying degrees  with golden syrup or similar.   I notice that the jar does not say  Ingredients  - then Honey - it simply says Honey... So either this is Tesco covering themselves by  not listing any other  ingredients  or Tesco perhaps needs to quality control their imported honey or research the import sources more thoroughly. This is one product which (in my opinion) should not be sold as honey.  I would be very interested in finding out what the actual situation is and I would be happy to send you a sample of the contents of my jar  in for analysis if required  though I very much believe this to be unnecessary.   The £1 I spent on this  product   has not persuaded me to purchase it again.  Regards Maria Parrott					2016-09-09T20:01:48+0000	1473451308	2016-09-09 22:01:48	1	9	2	0	11	9	1	8	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

I use my local Tesco store on a daily basis with my family and this week I have been disgusted at how a female security guard has stopped me more than four times in the course of five days. She has done this with no discretion. On all occasions she has been proven wrong. She has also stopped me to accuse me of stealing a shopping basket from the store!.... As well as to check my items that I walked in with. I have a very large Silver Cross vintage pram so I use the large shopping tray underneath for my shopping. Not only does she make a point of looking under my pram when i enter the store but also when I leave. She also makes a point of watches me on camera around the store as well which gives me the impression she victimising me. I am embarrassed for my self and my children who go to the local school as I have been stopped in front of my daughter s school teacher and her friends and other locals. Every time she makes a point of stopping me she does not apologise for doing it;  I just get a smug smile which is very offending after the embarrassment she puts me through. She has also told me not to use my shopping basket under my pram and if I walk into the store with shopping under it I have to show her before I get on with my shopping. i am totally shocked at the way I have been treated. It is harassment for no reason					2016-09-09T19:27:48+0000	1473449268	2016-09-09 21:27:48	0	2	0	0	2	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Placed an on line order 26 Aug said it would be available for collection 31 Aug. Got an e mail 28 Aug confirming order despatched will be ready 31 Aug. No communication from Tesco on 31 to say was available for collection. Called in store today to see where it was. Assistant said if you not got e mail it won t be here to which I replied i know that I want to know where my order is as it has been despatched!! His reply do you want to ring them - erm no I expect you to ring and find out where my order is!! He then rang  and his response was do you want a refund? Erm I wanted to know where my order was!! His response was I don t know!! At which point I asked for a refund - Tesco mission states  serving shoppers a little better everyday   - well not today!! Tesco value states  no one tries harder for customers   - well not today!! Tesco value also states  every little helps makes a big difference  - well today Tesco you did not make a big difference for me - absolutely shocking customer service					2016-09-09T19:24:36+0000	1473449076	2016-09-09 21:24:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In my quest to defeat the mutant demon hordes of university study and letter writing  I have made a perilous journey to Tesco s 3 times this year to obtain the one pen to rule them all; the parker jotter on offer. 3 times I have be defeated by other literacy warriors seeking this rare prize and claiming the last one.   I find myself with lesser weapons of literacy and know deep down that given the chance  this epic pen and myself could change the world. Now the time hast come where once again  I prepare to wage war with an evil foe of ageless enmity - my first assignment of the year; and know that should the fabled pen of silver appear again in my lifetime  I may have a shot at greatness.

She has stopped me more than three times in front of the entire store and in front of my children to interrogate me over what is under my pram  (I have  a large Silver Cross pram and use the under basket to hold my shopping). I was not stopped four times over a long period but over the course of five days. She can clearly see what I have when I walk into the store as she always looks under my pram and watches me on camera. I have also been accused of stealing a Tesco basket from the store which is a crazy accusation as it is clearly a pram basket. I am totally embarrassed  especially when my daughter s local school teacher walked past me today while she had me stopped telling me that I must show and tell her of having things from other shops before I start shopping in the store or i must use a trolley to shop .I am  totally put of using my local store due to the on-going humiliation this causes me and my family especially my children who go to the local school.					2016-09-09T18:07:58+0000	1473444478	2016-09-09 20:07:58	1	9	1	0	10	9	1	8	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My 10 month old daughter was upset from being unwell. Linda  who was managing the staff on the tills  unpacked my trolley  packed my shopping bags and even came and put my shopping in my car.  What a great service and a lovely lady.  I hope this gets forwarded to her and she receives some acknowledgement for this. I was thinking of abandoning my shopping and walking out if it wasn t for her. Thank you					2016-09-09T15:22:08+0000	1473434528	2016-09-09 17:22:08	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can safely say  I am thoroughly shocked and disgusted with tesco. On speaking with the complaints team today about an incredibly serious situation  we had a complaints team leader LAUGH  be horribly smug  AND PUT THE PHONE DOWN ON ME when I asked for his name and to speak to a manager. Crying on the phone and being so nice  I was thrown aside  ignored  and hung up on. Tesco has now officially lost a customer who spends at least 50 pounds a day with them. I will be going as far with this complaint as I need to  and as far as I possibly can.					2016-09-09T15:17:40+0000	1473434260	2016-09-09 17:17:40	3	8	3	0	11	8	2	6	0	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

Today I went to collect my order and basic items - a whole chicken and a packet of chicken breast- were only dated until tomorrow! Absolutely no use  so I left them. Ended up going in to the store to get them which totally defeats the purpose of ordering online! So  frustrated at the waste of time.					2016-09-09T15:17:22+0000	1473434242	2016-09-09 17:17:22	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

After using your supermarket for many a year and having home delivery  (your delivery drivers are always happy and friendly)   I m now a bit disappointed as for some unknown reason I can no longer get my green peppers for our fajita Friday and curry Thursday from you.  Whether it s just pure prejudice against the lonely green  you ve had a falling out or whether they do not like making their way to the north of Scotland  I do not know and will not judge  but our fajitas are just not the same without a green pepper.  Kind regards   Catherine					2016-09-09T14:55:05+0000	1473432905	2016-09-09 16:55:05	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I will be looking forward to the response as I have had no luck so far and I will be escalating this issue higher if not sorted out swiftly.					2016-09-09T14:07:13+0000	1473430033	2016-09-09 16:07:13	0	7	0	0	7	7	2	5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

POSITIVE FEEDBACK - There is an employee at the the Milton branch In Cambridgeshire Called CYNTHIA who primarily works on the cigarette counter...This Lady NEEDS AN AWARD for her services...She is the Nicest Person I think I have EVER met working for one of theses stores. I am a disabled shopper who needs to use a motorised cart to be able to gather my shopping. From the moment I enter the store  Cynthia greets me with a warm smile  a bright and cherry hello and pleasantries. She then  before Ive even made it to the counter  has a scooter key ready and is unplugging the scooter and physically brings it to me...This lady IS the reason I use said store as she truly makes my shopping experience a LOT easier......it may seem small to you  but to me she is a little lifeline and she certainly deserves something from the company as she truly is an asset to your company.					2016-09-09T13:59:25+0000	1473429565	2016-09-09 15:59:25	84	17	93	5	115	17	17	0	13	0	84	9	0	0	0	0	0

Excited that I can get 500 bonus clubcard points after using it five times!   (I like anything that gives me extra points  if anything  to make up for the times my clubcard app doesn t work at the till!)   Except I can t get those bonus points and can t use payquick because this store is not equipped for this feature! Why roll out a fantastic app and then NOT roll it out in all stores?  So disappointed that this has happened. Such a lack of organisation and training too! The poor girl on the checkout has never heard of this TESCO payment app! Nor have any Tesco employees in the smaller stores I have enquired in  (Billingshurst  broadwater  Tesco fuel stations etc)  I had come to Tesco to shop today because I could use my phone to pay and that s all I had on me!  The fact that this usually  staunchly loyal Tesco customer is annoyed yet again  probably means I ll go to the Billingshurst or Pulborough Sainsburys for a while and give my dusty nectar card a good outing!   This is in no way a reflection on Bbh Tesco as a store  I happen to know that manager Lee is incredibly good at what he does! It s always very clean and 98% of the time  I will get what I went in for.   I m disappointed that I was able to download the app and register my payment details  and my clubcard  get two emails gently reminding me to use the app and at no point did I get a warning that I could have to travel miles to use it!					2016-09-09T13:54:33+0000	1473429273	2016-09-09 15:54:33	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I m really angry about the fact that I was told it would take no more than 24hours for the money to go back onto my card! I still have not been refunded for this game £46 I payed for it and I m still out of pocket by £46 because of your store! This is not the first time that I have had a problem with this particular store  the staff was quite rude to me when I returned the game and accused of lying about the faulty game  I have brought ps4 and ps3 games from this store and every single game i have ever purchased has always had a fault in!  I feel like you have stolen from me because you are quick enough to take my money that I spend in store or online but yet don t bother giving my money back. After this incident I am seriously considering stopping shopping at tesco all together and at every store that bares the tesco name cheers for that 👍					2016-09-09T12:45:03+0000	1473425103	2016-09-09 14:45:03	1	12	1	0	13	11	3	8	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tried to find a way how to contact your complaint car insurance page  but  it is made impossible  so  I am writing here. If I don t get the reply soon  I will be forced to use other social media to try to fix the problem that my family and I are going threw. So  we bought Tesco car insurance  because  we trust your company and already are your regular customers. My husband is very sensitive driver and never had to make any claim. But recently somebody crushed into our car in residential area and run (no cctv cameras). We had to claim from our insurance to fix the damage. The way we have been treated is disgusting. We didn t even have right to get normal rental car. Instead  we got coutosy car that smells like cigarettes  dogs  cats and there are buggies wiped on the inside of the car. We made complaint and they did get it washed but not the way it should be. Only windows and vacuum cleaned. Buggies are still there as well as smell. There is also dog bites inside of the car and gears do not work properly. But we still cannot get normal courtesy car  because the person who damaged it run away. Why are we punished?! To make things harder  we have small child and I am in my last stage of pregnancy. Stressed 24/7 and scared to be driven to the hospital in it in case it dies on the road while I am in labour. I am scared to bring my newborn baby from hospital in case that she get some infection from the car because newborn babies immune system is not developed yet.  It makes me sick in my stomach the way your insurance is treating us. We feel anything but insured  covered and safe. Very bad customer service! Hope you fix that soon.

The driver manager at our local store accepted responsibility and said he’d submitted a claim to your insurance company. I have been chasing this since 22nd July with countless calls to Tesco  our local store and the insurance company. Whenever I call I am told I either have to speak to someone else or someone needs to investigate and call me back. It s over 7 weeks now.

However the girls selection is literally 3 aisles full of things . I know there s this new thing out where people are trying to get rid of gender names. But I refuse to dress my son in a dress just because this newer generation is full of snowflakes who get offended by every little thing. There should be more options for baby /toddler boy clothes in your Sudbury store.

Roy works at the Medows shop in Blackwater and was amazing . As this was my first online order he took the time today to explain everything to me today and helped me put away the groceries. I will definitely be ordering more from Tesco. Amazing service . Thank you .					2016-09-09T09:40:52+0000	1473414052	2016-09-09 11:40:52	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I then checked the stock in my local branch and  as they had it in stock  I decided to go there and pick it up immediately rather than ordering via click and collect. Can you explain to me why  in the 2 hours between checking the stock and visiting the branch  the price had gone up to £49  both online and instore? Not very customer friendly  and has definitely cost you a sale on this occasion  as I have now ordered a similar printer (Deskjet 3632) from Argos which was £15 cheaper.					2016-09-09T08:49:51+0000	1473410991	2016-09-09 10:49:51	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ordered Sunday money taken out and confirmation sent for delivery yesterday between 8-10pm  I have been away all week with work and these bottles are for my husbands 40th birthday party TOMORROW.  I ring at 10.50 to find out if they were turning up  keep me holding for 10 mins eventually I put it down and call on my landline because of the cost.  It tells me they are now closed!  I call first thing this morning kept waiting 10 minutes and then told the shop didn t get the order and can t deliver today maybe on Saturday - I pointed out if it doesn t turn up on Saturday - I was be in a real mess.  Offered no other solution than to cancel my order - honestly - I am a first time customer   don t you want me to return? I am so angry don t offer a service that is suppose to make life easier if you can t fulfil that obligation.  If any one asked for a recommendation I would have to tell them not to use you to by wine delivery service.					2016-09-09T07:50:18+0000	1473407418	2016-09-09 09:50:18	0	5	0	0	5	5	2	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This time last year I was a brand new mum. I d had a pretty traumatic birth and had a particularly miserable baby girl  who cried a lot and I was very tired and stressed. In the 6 weeks following her birth I hadn t been out with her on my own  so when my husband went back to work I made the decision to venture inti town and go to Tesco to get some groceries. It was a hard journey for me  I was very anxious and tired and just when I was nearly done shopping my daughter started screaming in her pram. I was so hot and bothered and flustered and I very nearly just dropped my basket and left when an angel appeared and helped me. The assistant stopped what she was doing and commented on how lovely my daughter was  asked me if I had found anything I needed  and escorted me to the till where she rocked my baby in her pram while I paid for my shopping. She was completely amazing - if it wasn t for her my confidence would have been totally rocked and I don t know I would have had the guts to go out alone with my baby again if it hadn t been for her help. Anyway! I told everyone I know how kind this member is staff was but in my flustered moment I never caught her name. The other day while filling up in the petrol station I saw her!! I asked if she remembered me and she said yes  I told her my daughter is 1 now and I thanked her so much. To some it may seem like such a small thing she did for me but I was just so grateful it made such a huge difference to me. I told her I would give her some positive feedback so here it is: Jennie @ Stafford Tescos  you deserve some love for being so lovely  happy  helpful and caring. Thank you for helping out this mummy when she needed a kind word and some gentle support.  ❤️					2016-09-09T07:46:39+0000	1473407199	2016-09-09 09:46:39	5	3	5	1	9	3	1	2	3	0	5	0	0	0	0	0	0

These were purchased on wednesday morning and stored as the should be. Today they are like this. Now im not normally one to complain  i walk away but this isnt the first time that you have failed on your fresh produce. This is minus the one i opened which was bruised right through  It may not seem like a huge deal to some but these are my daughters fruit for school breaks.  Can I ask what exactly what you do to the bananas to cause the enzymes to grow so quickly after purchase? Im hoping them being weighed does trigger off some sort of internal tesco switch causing the premature aging and bruising of said bananas in order to lure us unsuspecting customers back into store for more money spending!?! Either that or your fresh produce emplyees are not being as careful as they should  which i doubt as they are normally great in Llanelli store . Im pretty sure even monkeys would turn down these  my daughter certainly did when i showed the the remains of what used to be her bananas.  So heres to the uneaten bananas from tesco  the ones which have probably been trasported in plastic bags to the store (f.y.i. they shouldnt be put in bags in helps the enzymes to ripen the banana) probably not in cold conditions (f.y.i storage at less than 10degrees slows down the enzymes and therefore the ripening process). I shall be off to A*da today (sorry dont want to swear at you 😉).....at least their bananas last longer than 48hours before becoming unedible!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14233166_10157337022990109_7246279272872498939_n.jpg?oh=8404e33f34269f802cd101e0425a67c1&oe=58EFAF4C	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14233166_10157337022990109_7246279272872498939_n.jpg?oh=e0263766dff852bb8ffec4ee76859662&oe=58EBE541	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157337022990109&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-09T06:51:15+0000	1473403875	2016-09-09 08:51:15	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

This week alone i have seen one guy take half a dozen loaves of bread along with countless pastries and another woman fill a trolley with 6p celery and then the debacle last night actually had customers being pushed out of the way who weren t even interested in this stuff. Don t get me wrong  i like a bargain as much as the next person if i happen to see one as I m passing but these people were waiting for the 20 minutes i was in the opticians.

I finished work at 1AM  and decided that I d like to go buy some pizza and garlic bread from Tesco to have as my dinner.     After driving from Central Milton Keynes to the Tesco in Kingston  I quickly made my selection and placed my items on the belt  only for the person on the till to ask the customers in front of me to close the gate behind them and informed me that it was self serve only.     Taken aback  I decided to leave my items there and select a different store whose dedication to customer relations is a lot stronger. Thank you to your employee who lost you a customer as I shall not be shopping at Tesco again  and will take my business elsewhere.

This evening at about 7pm I went to Tesco with my 3 month old baby. As I carried him across to the trolley area  a young man of about 18 working as a trolley collector saw me coming and immediately moved a twin baby trolley out of the way and took the single one out and brought it over to me and then held it steady while I strapped my baby in. I wish I d looked at his name badge such a thoughtful man really going the extra mile! He did this before I d even noticed that the twin one was in the way. I have several times before had to negotiate moving trolleys in and out in order to get to the one I needed while holding my baby and shopping bags. I hope you can make this man an example of what good customer service really is and help your other employees be so helpful!					2016-09-08T21:44:31+0000	1473371071	2016-09-08 23:44:31	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My Mum bought these oven gloves from Tesco  after three uses you can see how burnt her hands are. She has contacted them many times  as she wants them to stop selling them till they ve been tested  . She gave the faulty oven gloves to the Sheerness store 2nd August  2016. As of Friday they still had not gone off to be checked to see why they were faulty and they are still selling them. Please let us know if you have know anyone who has been hurt from the same gloves? 	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14237706_10209061901238803_3468820647005004887_n.jpg?oh=989d25e4c1fbd0a3735c58525b760b0d&oe=5917D473	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14237706_10209061901238803_3468820647005004887_n.jpg?oh=ffae6b07b48b57d1ce8ef74a557cc8f2&oe=58E6187E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209061901238803&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-08T21:19:46+0000	1473369586	2016-09-08 23:19:46	0	6	0	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Unfortunately  I have another one!!!  .I bought a Family chicken & broccoli bake .cooked it for dinner last night Sept 7th .It was in the reduced section  paid 95p .Use by Sept 7 . o.k  SO VERY GLAD I did`nt pay the full price £ 6.30.or I would have  been really up set .  It was so full of salt It should have been called  Salt pie    (upon reading the contents  5  contain salt) Chicken was almost invisible  . Carrot s stringy & hard .Broccoli  was like tree twigs  !!! Where are your product testers allowing such an item as this on your  shelves .???   Definitely would not recommend this product .  *** I have decided that from now on I am going to continue to  complain  as I feel Tesco in Northern Ireland are way below the main land standards					2016-09-08T21:05:25+0000	1473368725	2016-09-08 23:05:25	0	3	0	1	4	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

She visited your Rugby store today to get help transferring data from her old phone to her new one and the member of staff there told her he wouldn t touch her cracked screen as he  could catch HIV or something.  My mum doesn t have HIV  but if she did  I d like to think your staff wouldn t treat her like that  and would instead try to talk her through what she needed to do to transfer her data instead of dismissing her like garbage. As a result she had to drive over to your Coventry Ricoh store where they were much more helpful.  I understand that health and safety is important for all of your employees  but perhaps a course in how to be a decent human being wouldn t go amiss for some of them.					2016-09-08T19:57:04+0000	1473364624	2016-09-08 21:57:04	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

The 5 Conference pears were  best before 29th August.  4 pears are still as hard as bullets whilst the 5th has gone rotten overnight. Why do I keep buying fruit from Tesco - it s a regular problem. A 30 minute walk each way or £3.40 bus ride to return them to the nearest store. They will just end up in the bin like the plums  peaches and other inedible fruit that I have had in the past.					2016-09-08T18:36:27+0000	1473359787	2016-09-08 20:36:27	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

We purchased 3 packs of nappies from yourselves on Sunday  I went to change my sons nappy on Tuesday after him wearing it for 2.5-3 hours to find that his bottom was covered in the crystals from the nappy! After changing his nappy to the same as I was out and they were the only nappy a I had and he was upset until I purchased new nappies and put him in one of them!  It s safe to say that we won t be buying the nappies again as I do not want this happening again and I would also know how I go about getting my money back as I have two unopened pack and one pack with about 6 nappies out of it and would like a full refund for the £10 as this is a faulty product.					2016-09-08T16:43:46+0000	1473353026	2016-09-08 18:43:46	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My son was shaken and upset that he had smashed the jar  and the man wiped the sauce off his shoe and told him not to worry as it was just an accident.

I m involved in a community event this Monday 12th September in Ilford  Essex. We are a group of volunteers organising a free meal and small gifts for families who are underprivileged in celebration of Eid. We are working on a referral only basis in conjuction with local women s refuges and food banks. We have been really lucky so far and have managed to source a hall and some local restaurants who are providing food free of charge. However we are struggling to get hold of other items such as disposable plates  cups and cutlery. We would also like to source some flowers for women who have fled domestic violence and small gifts for the children. We also need some drinks  serviettes  black bin bags and baby wipes. I ve contacted my local superstore in Goodmayes and they provided me with an email address to put my request in writing  but it s been 2 days now and I ve not had a reply. With the event only a few days away I m starting to panic a little as we still need so much. Is there anything you can do to help us please? I know that Tesco actively support community events and we would love to have you guys on board  we are excited by this event and any support or donations would be greatly appreciated. Please do get in contact with me at your earliest convenience.

It s been well over a 2 years since I had any type of money off vouchers that should be sent out  randomly  yet other people I know have had them loads of times and they don t weekly shop there. You can say as much as you like that they are randomly sent out but it looks to me like it s a case of not looking after regular customers. Anyway my future is sainsburys.					2016-09-08T15:33:57+0000	1473348837	2016-09-08 17:33:57	1	7	1	0	8	7	4	3	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

What she did really hurt me and she didn t even apologise but felt it was necessary to shout at my mother. Getting use to this attitude from the staff at Inverurie Tesco. Some are absolutely brilliant. But the ones who are like this really let down the shop. I only shop there if I really have to now because I m getting fed up with staff who think they can shove disabled people out the way.					2016-09-08T15:19:17+0000	1473347957	2016-09-08 17:19:17	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Just got home from there. Half way round penny (3.5 months) wanted a feed so I lugged her out of seat and started pushing while feeding. Lots of people chatted to me and said how well I was doing and how lovely it was to see. A big muscley guy buying energy drinks even smiled and said  got your hands full there  then the manager came over and said  do you want someone to push your trolley for you?  Was SO nice! I didn t take them up on it (I think it would have led to a screaming fit from my toddler and I was managing ok [I m used to walking and feeding]) but it was so nice. It was such a lovely shopping experience.  and lots of things on offer!! Persil non bio powder  (45 washes) £5.50 down from £11! I ve NEVER seen it that cheap anywhere!  I ll have a spring in my step all day after that... little things :) 					2016-09-08T15:00:08+0000	1473346808	2016-09-08 17:00:08	36	7	41	4	52	7	6	1	15	0	36	4	0	0	0	0	0

I m coeliac and vegetarian and find it hard to get stuff that s gluten free and vegetarian. You are the only company to produce gluten free vegetarian gravy  which yes  I can make my own  but sometimes it s good to have convenience  especially when I make so much stuff from scratch in the first place. Please keep your free from range as good as it is. I used to use Sainsbury s but their range has gone right down  hardly having anything anymore. And your gf apple pies are gorgeous. The only negative is that I m sure you used to do a gf vegetable lasagne  and now I can t find it in any stores. Otherwise  thanks for doing so much and hope it will improve anymore. Veggie gluten free sausages would be good!					2016-09-08T11:56:21+0000	1473335781	2016-09-08 13:56:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

They were in stock so i scanned them both on the self scan handset  but the offer did not come up (they were on a separate shelf than where the others were with the BOGOF signage).  I then asked a colleague if they were on offer as well as the other sizes  and she said she would take them to see.  She scanned them through a till but the offer did not come up (she showed me the till receipt) so she informed me that they were not on offer  so i left without them.  I thought this was pretty rubbish (and was going to moan about that to you today TBH) but i have checked your .com store and they ARE listed as on offer?!? What is going on?? I m going to have to go back now to get them AGAIN and risk being told they are not on offer AGAIN (or they are now out of stock).  I m not a happy bunny :(					2016-09-08T10:35:11+0000	1473330911	2016-09-08 12:35:11	1	5	1	0	6	5	1	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

To the pharmacy assistant who glared at my three year old daughter who shouted when she dropped an item she was holding from the trolley  then told her she was noisy and she would have to learn to be quiet...words fail me. My daughter is loud as all toddlers can be but her manners far outweigh yours and I will not be using your pharamacy again. To the lovely lady in Customer Services who was compassionate when I explained the upset and was so wonderful with both myself and my daughter - thank you sincerely.   To Tesco management  your store is literally a stones throw from Aldi. I could save myself a few pounds by shopping there instead but have stayed as a loyal customer with you as I am truly appreciative of good customer service. I would be taking my custom elsewhere had it not been for the kindness shown by the lady (whose name I wish I had) on the Customer Support desk. In such a consumer competitive market  I would have expected better behaviour from your staff.					2016-09-08T10:25:10+0000	1473330310	2016-09-08 12:25:10	0	4	0	0	4	4	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As they don t live nearby I asked at the till for a gift receipt and was told to go to customer services. You can imagine my surprise when  I asked this same question at customer services to be advised you don t issue gift receipts. When I explained that the items were a present I was told that I would still have the receipt so it wouldnt be a problem.  The issue is how many people send a gift to a friend 500 miles away with the receipt so they can see how much they have spent. I found that suggestion a little odd and was frankly suprised you don t offer gift receipts.  I promptly left without any of the shopping i went in for and will no longer shop in your stores for gifts for friends.					2016-09-07T22:08:38+0000	1473286118	2016-09-08 00:08:38	0	8	0	0	8	8	4	4	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Then it tells me something is wrong with my payment card? Then it s my club card vouchers.  I call up to speak to someone and then explain the problem. I sit there patiently waiting for a response and the lady is silent for 2 minutes and then when I ask her is there a problem she snaps at me  well I need you to tell me what the error message is saying? I can t do anything?    What was she doing for the whole 2 minutes??..  Then I get transferred to someone else and have ended up calling 3 times to end up giving up and deciding clearly tescos does not the £100 of my money.  So basically spent money on phone bills  4 hours of my life wasted and end result was  after calling up again.. Well if you want we will transfer you to the phone shopping department where I will have to hunt around again trying to find the products online because my basket had cleared again..  I love tesco I really do but this has infuriated me and I think you should be aware your site is doing this rather than staff giving the attitude of  oh well   Hopefully if you want to discuss this I hope my calls were recorded so you can hear for yourselves   Jo Cachia   👍					2016-09-07T21:47:19+0000	1473284839	2016-09-07 23:47:19	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I recently converted from sainsburys to tesco at the start of the year...  I burst my tyre in tesco car park due to a barrier been taken out and left.  I spoke to the manager who said I should be entitled to my money back on the tyre because it s obviously been  neglected  and should of been sorted ages ago.  I parked in the children s bays where this old barrier is and it is a tight turn so had to mount the curb to get out as I couldn t reverse because of the way the car parking spaces are positioned.   My partner spoke to tesco today and there reply was that it s not their problem as I mounted the curb ... Not that the barrier in question should not be neglected just a tough luck... I would of even taken vouchers for the tyre but nothing  just washed their hands off it.  Never again will I shop at your stores.

I have made suggestions of a locked barrier to be put in place to reduce this issue or spore bumps with barriers around the car park. I was told that this would be looked into and resolved. Surrey Police safer neighbourhood team are aware of this. And I have been keeping notes of the goings on but feel that tesco should do something to help curb this as it is your car park. There are many residents that are fed up of all these goings on especially ones with small children and babies.

I recommended your shop as it s cheap and especially good on back to school items. We got there and found exactly what she needed for an absolute bargain price which was great. I then thought I ll do a few bits of shopping for myself and thought to pick up a few bottles of cider for my dad as it was on offer and I had my ID with me and thought I d treat him! So we went to the check out  my sister used the self scan quickly for the shorter queue whilst I waited in line as I knew I would probably be Asked for ID. My sister waited on a bench for me to finish. So as the lady started putting my things through she then came to the beer and asked for ID (absolutely fine which I expected her too) so I got out my driving license for ID and asked for a bag and then to my absolute amazement  she rudely pointed to my sister and very nastily said to me  Has she got ID too  now i know shops have to be strict on ID which is absolutely fine but let s just remember It s ME at the check out  ME buying the items  ME paying for it and ME with the ID. No of course my 16 year old sister who ISNT buying the alcohol doesn t have ID why would she need it for buying back to school items????? The lady then refused to give me the alcohol. I m sorry but I didn t know the law was you have to be 18 along with everyone else with you!!!!!!! Say if my sister was 5 years old would you still ask the 5 year old for ID??? NO you wouldn t. Say if I was a young mom and she was my daughter would I not be able to shop for beer with her just cause she wouldn t have ID???? I m sorry but I am very disgusted after my trip and will not be returning again!!! At the end of the day I was buying the alcohol and I had the correct ID so why was i not allowed to have it????					2016-09-07T20:00:04+0000	1473278404	2016-09-07 22:00:04	11	37	12	2	51	36	9	27	36	0	11	0	0	0	0	1	0

That s just my first page too.  Not a happy customer and I have been a customer for years.					2016-09-07T19:15:15+0000	1473275715	2016-09-07 21:15:15	0	12	0	0	12	12	1	11	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Kudos on an awesome creation. I bought my daughter the new sheepskin type gilet in size 12-18 months and sadly a new start has left the tag on the pocket. The alarm didn t sound otherwise id of dealt with the issue there and then. I can t find the receipt   I never keep track of them. Can I still take it back to branch to have the tag removed or is that a tenner gone?					2016-09-07T18:46:30+0000	1473273990	2016-09-07 20:46:30	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Once again i must post how poor the fruit and veg quality are at out local branch. The dates for use are at best 3 days but last week we threw two oranges and grapes within 2 days. On average we throw various fruit and veg within 3 days as it just suddenly turns. What on earth is going on? Two years ago this was NOT an issue?  We find fruit and veg from waitrose lasts longer and is of better quality? Yes it costs more but lasts a dam sight longer!  Get your act together as im getting tired on raising this issue and like others i may start shopping elsewhere.					2016-09-07T18:09:11+0000	1473271751	2016-09-07 20:09:11	2	4	2	0	6	4	4	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firstly  I bring my 5 year old up to the till to check a price of a toy to be told it s €5 because he had €10 I said he could get 2 only to go and pay to be told there €15 each. To say he was disappointed was an understatement. After finding him something else I went to pay for everything only to be overcharged. I pointed this out to the cashier who sends me over to customer service for a refund. I go over and it s closed and no one around. I ask some who says they will send someone over only to be left standing there. I am joined by two other people and we only get served when the women that joined me called a staff member she knew. I was waiting for 10 minutes. Once the refund is complete on my card  I m told I don t get a receipt but if I haven t received the refund in a couple of days to come back. I check my bank and they payment is there but no refund. Seriously is this the best you have offer your customers now.					2016-09-07T17:33:31+0000	1473269611	2016-09-07 19:33:31	0	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Eating my beautiful simple salad at lunchtime to munch on this caterpillar! Good job I stopped to check what it was before swallowing! The fact that I am vegetarian causes me the most distress in a suitable for vegetarians food product  can you explain this?   I think it is utterly disgraceful in a ready to eat product! Never using tesco again you have made me feel ill!

As though having a toddler  a husband and fish is not enough  you d like me to adopt one of your insects that I very kindly brought home from your Hamilton Tesco store! 😐 My son was holding this and was about to take a big juicy bite! To his horror I stopped him and said  No we have to wash fruit first!  He very sadly replied  ohhh   Whilst washing I came across a muddy hole!! So picked at it!  Being me.. I was intrigued and decided to cut into this big juicy strawberry!!  To my disgust!!!!!!! This insect bug maggot 🐛 whatever you want to call it pops out! 😲...  I was thinking that one of could have eaten this and had an extra crunch! The poor creature 😩 How sad (wish you could see the sarcasm in my facial expressions) .....   Please could you make sure your productions area are checking through these fruits properly as I am absolutely disgusted!!!  Now I have become a paranoid fruit inspector !!

Mostly I am happy with the quality and service  BUT there are somethings that could be better.  You have fishmonger counters where there should be TRAINED operatives.  Request a trout cleaned and scaled well you get one opened from the jaw to the tail  the gills are not removed  the guts are gone but the blood line is not removed from the backbone  and obviously someone has scraped a knife in a strip down the side of the fish leaving 99% of the scales still on the fish. This week I ordered Salmon Side  now whilst the fish had been filleted well and the pin bones removed  the skin was not touched leaving all the scales for me to remove.  I have in the past cleaned and filleted Salmon  the first thing that should be done is to remove the scales  it makes the removal of the skin easier!  It also means if the salmon is to be served with the skin then the diner does not have inedible skin.  I think it would be a good idea if the Fishmongers were to have at least 1 day at a local catering college where they could be introduced to the basics of cleaning scaling and filleting fish.					2016-09-07T15:44:11+0000	1473263051	2016-09-07 17:44:11	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

It has been so hard finding products that cover everything found in milk. Now  although I can t have any desserts in eat out places  I can still come home and indulge! Hopefully there will be a range of desserts like these in popular eating places someday......until then I can enjoy my desserts at home. I love the free from smoked cheese too....lovely with some spicy salami  onion and then grilled.

You have now changed the layout and recipe for this and the new version is an absolute fail.  It is now in a split tray  the film lid won t peel off evenly to stir at the half way point  there are now no whole green beans but flecks of green and the rice was beyond sticky as it was completely clotted in a lump. Also the Jalapeno peppers mask any other flavour. I will not be buying this new version again  the product is very disappointing.

Called up customer services who immediately apologised (thank you!) then get in touch with the duty manager at Camelon. Less than an hour later  a new cake was delivered to my door  a refund was given for the previous cake and most importantly I had a very happy boy the following day. I imagine you guys get a fair amount of flack but I just wanted to balance it out with some positive feedback 😀🎂🍰 Thank you again.					2016-09-07T13:55:32+0000	1473256532	2016-09-07 15:55:32	69	8	69	4	81	8	4	4	9	0	69	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have just tried for over 20 minutes to checkout! The new system that seems to have appeared is complicated and rather irritating!   every little helps...  is a phrase I live by   I don t have alot of money   so booking a 1hr slot for a set price suited needs just fine   upon realising your NEW flexible feature I tried to book several times without success ( and constantly being bounced back to the home screen)  once I gave up and just paid a higher delivery ( still took several attempts)  all was well.... So I thought   Now I usually  screen shot  the confirmation page   just to remind myself... Only for my phone to inform me that the  page is protected  and I can no longer save that image   Please   stop playing around with things that work perfectly well ( and consider speaking with your app development department... If it works   leave it alone!)    Kind regards Yvonne   Ps I m rather miffed about all this!					2016-09-07T13:44:36+0000	1473255876	2016-09-07 15:44:36	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

However not everyone goes back at the same time. For example  my 4 year old daughter is starting her first year of school this year. Her first full-time start date is the 19th September  with some other children opting into starting a little later. I decided I would buy her uniform much closer to her start date (because they grow so fast!). And after we had had her teacher visit her at home. I knew Tesco were selling some basic school clothes so I planned on heading there. Only just a week ago I saw the uniform all up on display  but today was a different story! I started to panic wondering where I would now get her uniform from. I don t drive and I am out of work so my options were limited. I frantically looked around for a member of staff and asked if by any chance you still had some of the stock outback. Luckily  a kind gentleman named Martin had over heard my conversation with another staff member and didn t hesitate to help me. He took me and my two children (I also have a 9 month old baby) outback and spent a good amount of his time making sure I had what I needed for my daughter to start school. He did a lot more than I would ever expect from a staff member and I wanted to make sure he was given some positive feedback for his efforts. I now have one happy 4 year old set and ready for her first day of school! Thank you #Martin from Whiteley Tescos. :) I also wanted to suggest to Tescos that maybe keeping some of the school stock out a little longer would be a consideration?					2016-09-07T12:44:07+0000	1473252247	2016-09-07 14:44:07	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am 9 months pregnant and the thought of the sickness this could have caused if I had not noticed prior to eating does not bare thinking about. I have already complained to Tesco on a number of occasions for staff at tills licking their fingers to open the carrier bags  staff selecting food for home delivery bagging up items from the fruit and veg isle licking their fingers before touching the fresh food and for a member of staff actually climbing into one of the fridges to reach something which could have quite easily contaminated the fridge and food with what ever she may have trood in. I can quite happily say I will not be shopping at Tesco again.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14192055_10154365902117349_2935913353525481562_n.jpg?oh=2a4de4c82c23a2fc51906bdd62c76a33&oe=58E5AB00	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14192055_10154365902117349_2935913353525481562_n.jpg?oh=20e14cd8d5b1dc2b3e2d4577ecc456fc&oe=5917F10D	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154365902117349&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-07T11:55:47+0000	1473249347	2016-09-07 13:55:47	2	1	2	0	3	1	1	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Tesco actually suggest  no  request  that we use social media  Facebook  Twitter  believe it or not! If you happen to be in a country where these are banned  China?  then bad luck  you must pay £10-15 per minute to call them  IF you happen have your UK SIM card with you when most people use local SIM cards. Local SIM cards don t allow international calls (unless you want to waste money)  hotels don t allow international calls in some countries because of the cost. So  really  you are out of luck UNLESS  you want to spend money getting a VPN so you CAN use social media AND want to spend days of your holiday/travels  conversing via social media with 12 hour delayed replies each way.

I had my shopping booked in for 10-2 today but for the first time ever i ran out of milk for my 1 year old this morning and husband was already in work and I don t drive. I rang customer services at 7.20 spoke to a lovely and helpful man and asked if there was any chance I could get my shopping a little earlier- didnt mind paying the extra delivery charge. He said he would sort something out and ring me back. 20 mins later he rang and said I was first on the list and my shopping would be with me around 9 ish. My shopping turned up at 8.20.  I am beyond relieved and all the staff were amazing.

Recently  On 2nd Sept   I bought RM129.98. And when the deliveryman sent goods to my house  there was a small portion  SAVE RM5 when you spend RM50 . attached below of the tax invoice.  Today  I spent another RM 153.30  i got the same amount of e-coupon RM 5.  Can you explain the statement  save rm5 when spend rm50 ? From my understanding  if i spend rm153.30  means i get rm5x3 .  I called Customer Service  she also was a bit  confused when giving explanation to me.  If customer only get RM5 coupon regardless the total of e-purchase..then you SHOULDNT write  Save rm5 when you spend rm50 ..  Just put  Save rm5 for spending rm50 and ABOVE  OR   With min e-purchase of RM 50 and above  you will save rm5   If I know it earlier  I will just split up my transaction from RM 153.30 to 3 transactions of each RM 50+.   Every customers are entitled for unlimited times of coupon RM5..right?  Bit dissapointed as tesco customer.  2nd inquiry : I never receive any email confirmation of my shopping list.  When you submit your items list   there is a message  an email confirmation will be sent to your email .  How is this happened?  Pls give me an explanation..Thank you					2016-09-07T06:15:03+0000	1473228903	2016-09-07 08:15:03	0	4	0	0	4	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

For such a big company after reporting this I actually expected feedback from yourselves! I provided you with my phone number and email address and I have heard nothing!! This driver drove so close to the back of me that I felt I was going to be pushed along and then proceeded to overtake me with only three inches gap away from my bike handles!!!!!! I have three children who when I got home  still shaking I may add I held so tight as this quite honestly scared me to death! Did this driver have to actually knock me off for you take this seriously? Absolutely outraged that your company feel this is not in need of actually following up by the way the vehicle in question was registration YN03 FOK driving at approximately 4:10pm on Friday 2nd September heading back from Lichfield direction to fradley distribution centre turning into wood end lane. #bewareofcyclists #tescocustomerservices					2016-09-07T05:02:31+0000	1473224551	2016-09-07 07:02:31	0	2	1	1	4	2	2	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

I have been trying to resolve a problem for some 3 weeks but cannot find the thread of the conversation anywhere. All I appear to be able to do is to send a message until you rely and then I can see the thread? Is there no way you can help your customers by giving them instructions on this what I think is a disgraceful communication method for problems. Or can you not email when there is a reply waiting to allow us to get on with our travels away from such things as facebook? I bank with several banks and have only recently started whith tesco. However  if this is the service system as soon as I get back to the UK I will withdraw my funds. No other bank uses social media for such problems as logging into online banking.					2016-09-07T03:51:22+0000	1473220282	2016-09-07 05:51:22	0	6	0	0	6	6	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have two small children and was quite frankly outraged by the delivery of goods in a vehicle that has an extremely loud reversing beeper  and squeaky shutter at gone 10.15pm. The noise in such a small cul de sac woke my 1 year old daughter. To add insult to injury  the delivery driver spoke loudly to a neighbour about the difficulties he had had with sat nav and also appeared to have the radio on in the vehicle.					2016-09-06T21:24:38+0000	1473197078	2016-09-06 23:24:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

On my way home  a Tesco home delivery van decides to cut me off after a set of traffic lights. I have dash cam footage but sadly it doesn t really show the reg plate as he was so close it was reflecting too much. I was expecting a bit better from a  professional  driver  not even a flash of the hazards or a wave  Just completely oblivious.  by the way  when i say professional driver i mean someone driving for and representing a company  Not professional as in someone actually qualified to drive a large vehicle. Not impressed..					2016-09-06T21:07:54+0000	1473196074	2016-09-06 23:07:54	1	6	1	1	8	6	3	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Upon cutting into the cake with a knife loaded with calorific expectation  we were dismayed to discover that our cake was in fact missing the cream cheese frosting between the cake layers. Upon taking it back to the shop for a replacement  both us and the shop attendants were shocked to discover that this was no anomaly - all of the other cakes suffered from the same cream-related inadequacy. It is with a heavy heart that we now find ourselves writing this post  instead of enjoying our dessert 😩🍰 Hopefully this is not indeed Tesco s  finest ...	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14237554_1735555893374362_5926551510878077390_n.jpg?oh=cef4b2930dfe919bbf01d9291422c235&oe=5917D2A8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14237554_1735555893374362_5926551510878077390_n.jpg?oh=76f15baddc757fadbe1702929fc82ea4&oe=58EA1DBD	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1735555893374362&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-06T20:21:03+0000	1473193263	2016-09-06 22:21:03	6	32	7	0	39	32	19	13	17	0	6	0	0	1	0	0	0

The delivery driver was well aware that this was my first delivery with you and welcomed me. Which I thought was very nice of him. He had a very welcoming manner and was definitely a credit to your business.  By the early evening I then received a phone call asking if everything was ok with my delivery. I have to say Well done to you. Something so small can make all the difference. I have never received this customer care from any of the other supermarkets I have previously used. I have my next online order ready and waiting for you. I will definitely be recommending you. And I just wanted to say Thank you :)					2016-09-06T20:18:49+0000	1473193129	2016-09-06 22:18:49	6	2	6	0	8	2	2	0	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

While the details aren t perfect because it was shot in the dark  hopefully you ll note that (a) it says  Please remove your card  (the normal message after you ve entered your PIN) and (b) there s no card in the slot. This is because I had already removed it. In fact  I removed it so long before the picture was taken that I had time to ask one of your staff  whose reply was  Oh? Is it still not working? - We ve been having problems with that one all day.   drive to another pump  fill my car up  then find your colleague again and suggest he put an out of order sign on the Pay at Pump bit  before finally coming back to take the photo. I m concerned because I ve then had no option but to drive off. If the pump ever works out that my card was removed before it s reset  someone else will be getting their petrol at my expense given that I effectively left it pre-authorised. Once repaired  I d also appreciate your confirmation that there is no skimming device on the pump. What I m most annoyed about though is that there wasn t a sign warning customers that it wasn t working before I started the transaction - perhaps you could re-train your staff?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14184278_10155166508189348_4737836807075444854_n.jpg?oh=a35476252f567d2255a796a33548375f&oe=58E3C9A2	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14184278_10155166508189348_4737836807075444854_n.jpg?oh=f5f17a75475c24007aaabe8f59e12bd5&oe=58E1B9AF	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155166508189348&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-06T20:16:31+0000	1473192991	2016-09-06 22:16:31	4	3	6	0	9	2	2	0	1	0	4	0	0	0	0	2	0

First off let me say how happy I am to discover your custard donuts are vegan (and therefore milk free). And your marble cake   it s honestly made my week.   But when it comes to your sweets   what are you playing at? Sprinkling milk powder round like it bloomin fairy dust. I mean what business does milk powder have in cherry sweets?   I m not actually vegan but I am breastfeeding a baby with a cow s milk allergy. That s right   you ve upset a sleep deprived mother who hadn t had chocolate or pizza for over 4 months.   Seriously though  can you look at sorting this when you review your sweets next   I d hate to have to go to another supermarket which doesn t put milk in its sweets. (I won t say who but their name begins with A and they re not German).   *Edited.  The afore mentioned products are not actually vegan  just milk free  they contain egg. See  this is what having a baby and not eating chocolate does to your brain. *	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14291779_10102271329444995_1107734572752800805_n.jpg?oh=0779760fb3680e5104ba4dda0c02647b&oe=59219CFF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14291779_10102271329444995_1107734572752800805_n.jpg?oh=13bcecdf2f8eb12665c37fa7c88f7b26&oe=58E7A1F2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102271329444995&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-06T16:47:38+0000	1473180458	2016-09-06 18:47:38	11	8	11	2	21	8	2	6	1	0	11	0	0	0	0	0	0

Vouchers that can t be used until 6 November. Do you really think anyone is going to keep hold of them for 2 months until they re finally valid?  Or are people just going to take them to the petrol station & get them declined - or scanned and then no points added? Great looking gesture  but completely meaningless.

This once excellent feature now excludes the olives  stuffed peppers  vine leaves and other  good   presumably lower margin  deli stuff which can only be bought separately now at the Chester store.

Decided to have lunch with my mum. I am disgusted at the way your customer services in the cafe are. Thought we would have a decent all day breakfast  to read a sign to say it s all cooked fresh to order  well believe me it s not. My breakfast was vile  my sausages were 1. anemic & 2. black  bacon was like rubber & beans were Cold. I m not one to complain  but this wasn t acceptable or satisfactory.   I complained to the 3 ladies serving to be looked at like I was in the wrong to complain  I asked if the food was cooked fresh to order to their reply yes  but clearly wasn t! They had such an attitude & I was quite reasonable to how I explained. They were rude & very unhelpful! They didn t believe me that there was a sign to say clearly that it was cooked fresh to order  so they went & looked after.   After this I was offered the same meal or a refund. Of course I declined the food & took the refund  I didn t eat as it put me off.  All in all  I m not happy & will not be experiencing having food in the cafe anymore. I will add photos.   Thanks.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14222105_10210489150328501_1933685581237864353_n.jpg?oh=54e8c89f5dd9add845a11942c8dbc474&oe=58E25992	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14222105_10210489150328501_1933685581237864353_n.jpg?oh=dab441d3ab60d0560d632ce2e0116597&oe=5923F59F	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210489150328501&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-06T13:59:18+0000	1473170358	2016-09-06 15:59:18	3	8	3	0	11	7	5	2	1	0	3	0	0	0	0	0	0

In April 2014 I purchased a TV and I was emailed confirmation of my free 5 year warranty for my product. It was due to this advertisement at the time that I purchased the tv from tesco. 2 years later the tv is no longer working properly. After CHASING tesco for months and them putting me in touch with their so called repair company who denied all responsibility tesco are now telling me that they refuse to honour their warranty as despite me having the printed email stating in black and white that I have this warranty they say they won t accept it because emails are not legally binding! DO NOT BUY FROM TESCO ONLINE they are liars and their customer service is the lowest of the low! I have just had a baby and can t really afford to buy a brand new tv but again but tesco do not care! I will be taking this up with trading standards as I was out and out lied to and have physical proof!

When I looked at these (this goes for other products in store) I was confused which box is better to get as when I looked at price per 100g the other pack is marked per kg. This is confusing to which one works out cheaper at a quick look. I don t want to spend hours with the kids working out the best deal. You do this for this reason but it is unfair on your shoppers.

Okay Search > joggers  this brings up a lot of entries so lets refine search by age >7-11 (i think thats what i picked by now i was getting a bit grumpy!) Results 4 items  so i click to look at these and find myself looking at 4 prams!  Never mind i can still scan the label of the ones i picked up that are the wrong size to order the correct one. Scanner doesnt work anymore. ANSWER >go next door to M&S because they 1. have it in stock and 2 if they didnt have an ordering system that works. And dont get me started on the search for a blue cardigan where your ordering system thinks Navy is blue when you have them listed as different colours  this really needs sorting out Tesco!					2016-09-06T11:20:32+0000	1473160832	2016-09-06 13:20:32	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

He was very patient and helpful and suggested things I could try to resolve the issue I had.  He even offered to keep me on the line while I tried the suggestions  which worked  by the way. Success! Sometimes we are quick to complain when service is not great (OK I ll put my hand up!)  but equally when we get a good service we should praise that individual.  So many thanks and sorry I didn t get your name  but hopefully you know who you are!  Liz					2016-09-06T10:43:07+0000	1473158587	2016-09-06 12:43:07	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We cancelled our cat s pet insurance in February this year. He went missing in August 2012  but we d kept the insurance going for 3 and a half years so he was covered in case he was found. Lo and behold  7 months after cancelling the insurance he was reunited with us  but very poorly and needing surgery to remove his left eye. I contacted your pet insurance team on the off-chance that they d be able to help  and they ve called back today  agreeing to reinstate his insurance and cover the cost of his treatment.   Begby is currently in surgery and I ll be picking him up this afternoon.   Thank you  Tesco. This is customer service like we ve never experienced before and we re so incredibly grateful! Please pass our thanks onto your insurance team.  Looking forward to having a happier Pusskins back this afternoon.   💙	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14212785_10102270730101085_7197035502785596677_n.jpg?oh=10e17d4b729a45a8aba8d765f2f83ae0&oe=58E364BD	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p180x540/14212785_10102270730101085_7197035502785596677_n.jpg?oh=346a529a3da6d1c611ca32257ed60a60&oe=58D66CC9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102270730101085&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-06T09:04:43+0000	1473152683	2016-09-06 11:04:43	27	6	32	2	40	5	5	0	7	0	27	4	1	0	0	0	0

Help? 03301340183. “ I checked my mobile phone balance and saw £4.50 has been taken. I only topped up yesterday so I could see straight away how much was missing. I rang Tesco Mobile on 0345 301 4455 and after navigating through the various options I spoke to someone who said there was nothing they could do and advised me to call the number supplied in the Scam Text message. I was reluctant to make any contact with a company that just robbed me but he insisted that was the only course of action I could take. I called the number 03301340183 and listened to a recorded (seemed very unprofessional) message asking me to press 1 to stop further messages if using the actual phone or 2 if it was for another phone and to enter that number. I got a text a few minutes later to confirm: All competition entries on this shortcode are now cancelled. No further messages will be sent. Any queries  just call Customer Services: 03301340183.					2016-09-06T08:56:27+0000	1473152187	2016-09-06 10:56:27	1	4	1	0	5	4	2	2	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Signed up for their payqwiq app.  First time I used it on self check out thought yes this is going to be so quick. Put all my stuff through scan my phone. What could be easier. Stays frozen on processing. I call the assistant over she messes with the till roll nothing. She calls the manager messes with the till roll nothing so she says I m sorry I ll have to print your receipt from the main computer.  10 mins later sheet of paper with my transaction on it.  Not such a quick system but I think ok first time these things happen.  Yesterday I return do exactly the same when I scan my phone it freezes on processing. Again various people come and mess with the till roll.  The managers says I ll print it from the main computer. Comes back 10 mins later says sorry I can t. I tell her I m not happy with out the receipt to tell me my transaction is complete.  My transaction could not be refunded because the till was still processing.  Eventually she said I ll get such a such he knows all about this system well along came such and such. Did exactly the same as everyone else with the same result. This was over an hour and I had to leave a very dissatisfied customer.  So later I ring customer services.  I tell my story the operator speaks to various people comes back and says were very sorry it happened.  That s really not enough there was no reassurance that this would be rectified.  I asked from the beginning for it to be raised as a complaint.  But no a sorry and what else do you want me to do madam is what I got. When I said I wanted my complaint raised and I wanted to know the out come he said sorry madame Tesco can not help you i will have to transfer you to the company that runs payqwiq and their very busy so you ll have to wait. I was less than happy at this point Tesco passing the but for a system that is operated in their store.  Tescos saying to a customer we can help you very poor show. Eventually  I m through to payqwiq the girl takes my name address email address I tell her my problem she says I m very sorry it s a new system when I say I d like to know the out come of my complaint she says Oh no we don t do that we don t contact people we just take the complaint.  What a disgrace Tesco you put in a new system you fail to train your staff on how to rectify problems with it. Your managers haven t a clue to the point they pass the but to an assistant and don t bother to come back and check the problem was resolved. Your customer service passes the butt and says it s not our problem. The company you use couldn t even reassure me it was a safe system to use and had the attitude of well listen to you complaint but we ll do nothing about it. Payqwiq nothing quick about it if I d of stood and payed with penny s it would have been quicker. As for your attitude to customer satisfaction what a disgrace. As for your whole payqwiq system my advice to everyone thinking of installing this app. STEER CLEAR GIVE IT A WIDE BERTH i would raise serious safety issues. I certainly would never use it again. But apart from that very disappointed in what was my main supermarket.					2016-09-06T05:57:38+0000	1473141458	2016-09-06 07:57:38	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I left my car keys at the checkout and he went over and beyond what was required and came running out to the car park to hunt me down and return them. He was a bit of a life saver as going back into the shop with two tired and fed up children in tow would have been a layer of stress I just didn t need on a Friday night ! Please make sure my thanks are passed on. Regards Katie					2016-09-05T22:45:52+0000	1473115552	2016-09-06 00:45:52	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Luckily I d only used half that bottle. Raided through the bin for the other bottle and that one was out of date too! Maybe I m a bad parent for not checking the dates but if something was bought on Saturday - which usually has a good shelf life you wouldn t have expected them to be so out of date.   One went out of date in February and the other is June. Phoned up Tesco and they just said come in for a refund and a good will gesture...

I have ordered and paid for a double bed frame to be delivered to my house. Received  a text message to say my bed was due for delivery today between 7am and 7pm.  It got to half past 1 this afternoon and I had heard nothing so I rang the number in the text message and spoke to a lady to ask if she could update me as to what time the frame was due to arrive. She then told me that the frame I had ordered had failed its quality control check and was not on its way to me and that in fact a replacement had been chosen for me and they were awaiting my approval. No one had bothered to contact me to tell me this and so it is not going to be Wednesday before my bed arrives! I asked the lady if she could tell me what time roughly it would arrive so I didn t have to waste another day waiting for the doorbell and she told me I would have to ring back after 4pm tomorrow to find out.   As a result of this poor service and sheer lack of communication I am not forced to sleep on my mattress on the floor because I am without a bed frame after selling my previous in time for the new one to arrive.   Will not bother buying anything else from Tesco direct and would like to know how you intend to resolve this complaint.					2016-09-05T17:59:14+0000	1473098354	2016-09-05 19:59:14	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Want to thank the four members of staff in tesco s today for helping me... only went to the shops to get a few bit s so grabbed a basket & had the pushchair!! But ended up with a few more bit s as lily was asking for this & that😀. Which I picked up for her so my basket was full & really heavy! & was stuggling to push the pram with the basket being so heavy!!! But still need to carry on shopping. So i headed to where the bread was when two of the works stopped me & asked if I was okay & would I like a trolly ( I said no thank you & I was okay & had the pram to push so couldn t have a trolly) the staff then said how much more you got to get ( I said only some bread I think) they then took my basket & said it will be sat waiting for you at a till for when you have finished getting all your shopping😊 i grabbed my bread & went to the till where my basket was they opened up the till & a member off staff put all my shopping on the conveyor belt for me. So thank you all for your help today was much appreciated...					2016-09-05T17:26:48+0000	1473096408	2016-09-05 19:26:48	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Totally sorted out my orders which I hadn t realised was going to a store not of my choice. So patient and nothing was too much trouble for him.

The shorts are £3 then to be charged £2 to collect them. How is thay possible to be charged for an item I ve paid for and when I m using my petrol and my time to go and collect the item. When I questioned a member of staff as to why this has been changed she referred me to the pathetic excuse of a notice which was placed on the counter. Politely told her I could read but that doesn t explain why your now charging to collect orders under £30. Why does it matter the amount you spend when the customer is one paying for the item and two coming to collect it. Yet and gain disappointed in tesco. Please address this personably and I would also like to know what your going to do about it. Do I bill you for the petrol used? It s not my fault the store failed to have sufficient stock ib for the past 6 weeks  ( and yes I ve been trying to get them even before the school holidays started).

As you can see from the photo I purchased this table salt a while ago. I would like to express my sincere disappointment in the fact that in the months that the salt has been in my ownership not once has it performed any parkour what so ever. I would have expect some tricking  within the early days but nothing not one cat pass. Obviously Tic Tac and Kash vaults would have been a little too adventurous for a simple table salt to achieve but one would have expected an underbar at least. Maybe you should consider labelling more closely to avoid future disappointment. #parkour #freerunning	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14199345_10153911446750172_1674397418452780955_n.jpg?oh=a6fb6a01e68c5e8e1650c8b2d0a7dfb2&oe=58D78EE1	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14199345_10153911446750172_1674397418452780955_n.jpg?oh=6c3c256f368ef7ce5ce954dc2898e77f&oe=58D8B2EC	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153911446750172&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-05T12:45:01+0000	1473079501	2016-09-05 14:45:01	8	4	21	4	29	4	4	0	26	0	8	1	0	11	0	1	0

My son saw a gentleman drop something  he picked it up and said excuse me you dropped this and handed it to the gentleman. A member of staff came over and wanted to reward my son for his act of kindness with some free chocolate of his choice. As a single mum I feel extremeley proud and wanted to thank the staff for recognising the kind act.					2016-09-05T12:30:09+0000	1473078609	2016-09-05 14:30:09	2	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

These men have always got a smile on their face  always have time to have a wee chat to you and in a world were everyone and every thing is usually done at speed and where people are quicker to complain than praise  their pleasant nature makes such a lovely difference. nothing is to much trouble to them  they even take the time to encourage my 3 year old grandson who has a disability to help take the shopping out of the crates  this is not always easy as he is very wary of people he doesn t know. All in all i am very pleased with the service i receive from your delivery drivers. Many thanks to each and every 1 of them.					2016-09-05T11:29:04+0000	1473074944	2016-09-05 13:29:04	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Money grabbing comes to mind!! I m disgusted in it  the staff already make sure you go around the store spending more money while you wait for them to get your parcel...... I ve had to wait almost 20mins before  because they kept getting the wrong parcel. This was a good service and I m disappointed you would charge people for ordering from you online and then collecting parcels themselves while spending more money in store.

At 9:50pm we received a call to say that we wouldn t be receiving it due to driver shortage. We don t live in a city  we live in a rural area where at 10pm you can t go out and buy packed lunch food and all of the other items ordered. My son has school tomorrow and we don t have any food for his lunch. The driver shortage is something that would have been known about earlier in the evening but no one communicated that information to us earlier. To top it off you have £140 of our money which we can t have back for 5 days! We have now had to change the delivery to Tuesday evening. I don t think that I would be on my own in saying that this is unacceptable from such a major store. The inadequacy shown to us by you tonight is indefensible.

I await your response regarding a refund on this product as it is not convenient to return it to store.

Whilst naming my daughters school tights ready for her first day back I came across something quite spectacular! Now we ve all been there as parent  you put your little munchkin to bed on a Friday after a long week of absorbing knowledge at school  and when Monday comes their trousers are up around their knees  and you re pulling their shirt cuffs out their armpits  because seemingly overnight they ve grown 2 inches! So I m sure you can imagine my delight upon finding that you now do  growth spurt  packs! Not only do I have a pair of tights for my eldest daughter to wear for the new school term  I have a spare pair ready for when that dreaded growth spurt catches me unaware  and BONUS... I even have a matching mini pair for her little sister to wear! Bravo tesco  I  and all the other mums with kids who grow like weeds  salute you!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14079545_10154526884389111_9190563340696294432_n.jpg?oh=5633f3d72075261d57eed9a7d58149cd&oe=58E78308	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14079545_10154526884389111_9190563340696294432_n.jpg?oh=a1fe2aa2ec06ad33e603c6ef2839c553&oe=58DE8C05	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154526884389111&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-04T21:04:40+0000	1473023080	2016-09-04 23:04:40	32	4	58	5	67	4	3	1	4	0	31	2	1	23	0	0	0

But I could not find those perfect shoes. So I visit Port Solent store with much disgust from my child but alas right before my eyes the only shoes that will do and in his size YES!!!! But they do not scan on hand scanner but still I have them in my grasp! Finish my shop  go to the till confirm I have an item that does not scan  man comes to help and tells me that he can not let me have these shoes because they have been removed from sales 😮😣😡😩 NOOOOO only these shoes were good enough for master and now we have to find more! He explained that the clothes department probably haven t been told they need to be removed from shelf and he can t possibly sell them to me despite my begging because it may be down to a safety issue. But on looking for another suitable pair we find more pairs of these forbidden shoes and I would like to think if an item is to be recalled then staff should be made aware of this straight away!?!? An email to the department or memo is all takes surely! So thanks Tesco for making back to school shoe shopping more exciting than it normally is.					2016-09-04T19:38:16+0000	1473017896	2016-09-04 21:38:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My little boy has a cows milk protein allergy  so cannot have any dairy products  and he is also allergic to soya (which is common in CMPA due to the proteins being similar).  Most of the dairy free  yoghurts  you stock contain soya- including all of the tesco own brand ones.  In our local store there are only 2 suitable yoghurts  both made by Coyo (made with coconut milk) and plain or vanilla flavoured.  In the other supermarkets I have managed to get dairy free yoghurts made by  Koko   in the following 4 flavours: raspberry; strawberry; peach and passion fruit; and coconut and lemon. They are much more palatable. Is it likely that you will be getting a wider range of dairy free stock which doesn t also contain soya?  Many thanks for your help.					2016-09-04T18:44:54+0000	1473014694	2016-09-04 20:44:54	2	3	2	0	5	3	1	2	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

They were designed to trick people to think they were made in the fresh green fields of a country farm in Great Britain when they re from South Africa or the Ukraine. There s nothing wrong with buying bananas from South Africa  stop lying to your buyers! Appalling. Avoid this store.

I bought Tesco roast in bag whole chicken  pork sage and onion stuffed for dinner today. In date until 8/9/2016. Got  roast potatoes  vegetables and gravy cooked  opened up the chicken bag after resting it  I was hit by the overwhelming smell of warm urine! This is the second time this has happened to me on a Sunday  the first was about 8 weeks ago. This not only means we had no roast chicken for today  it means I had to cook other chicken that was intended for later in the week and I do not have the left overs for tomorrow s lunches  I am not only out of pocket for today s meal (for family of 3) but for 2 other days as well...that is 9 meals in total. I am very unhappy. I think because we only have Waitrose   Lidl and Aldi nearby that Tesco think it doesn t matter if the quality isn t there as where else is the equal competitor?  I am seriously considering Waitrose as I will not be wasting money having to buy lots of extra food to replace bad produce the cost will be about the same.					2016-09-04T17:56:49+0000	1473011809	2016-09-04 19:56:49	1	5	3	1	9	5	5	0	3	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	0

I usually order an extra large one for 2 adults and 2 teenagers with always some left over (usually going to the dog)  but with one adult down for Sunday roast this week I deliberately did not order the extra large. However the cauliflower I received fitted in the palm of my hand - please tell me how I am supposed to split that between 3 people?  it didn t even weigh 200g by the time it had been cut into florets and would have been more suited for a meal for one. Not only that it cost me 95p  I could have got a 400g bag of prepared cauliflower/broccoli florets for £1.00.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q88/s130x130/14265078_10153808856748053_6264452118516472913_n.jpg?oh=8bc41567b19309f46043db136855523b&oe=591FF458	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/q88/p180x540/14265078_10153808856748053_6264452118516472913_n.jpg?oh=29a4c856556fab7cde2657992c3884be&oe=58D62B2C	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153808856748053&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-04T17:48:04+0000	1473011284	2016-09-04 19:48:04	5	1	7	0	8	1	1	0	0	0	5	0	0	0	0	1	0

I am baffled as to how you can justify charging customers to come and collect the items themselves. Safe to say it has stopped me ordering the items I needed and I also could not find them in the stores either hence why I went online. So I will be shopping elsewhere.					2016-09-04T16:44:46+0000	1473007486	2016-09-04 18:44:46	2	6	2	0	8	6	3	3	3	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

He usually loves buying a nice big super saver bag of toilet rolls  and today he came home very pleased with himself after picking up a bargain of tescos luxury soft 24 pack for £8. Imagine his utter horror when he discovered the roll he proudly popped on the right hand side of our double toilet roll holder  only to find it had no perforations! On checking the other rolls he found they also had no perforations. What would you suggest we do? Take a pair of scissors into the bathroom? Leave an unsightly jagged edge hanging from our rather posh holder? Pls advise. Many thanks					2016-09-04T16:33:21+0000	1473006801	2016-09-04 18:33:21	0	3	0	0	3	3	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A call to your Hudl team on Friday evening promised a call back yesterday (Sat 3 Sept) or Monday with an offer as I am not happy at having a third repair arranged when the previous repairs have left me with a device I cannot use and which I used my hard earned Clubcard vouchers to buy.  Remember  the Clubcard points were halved so I had to spend twice as much with you to earn them.  You also did away with the green Clubcard points.  The Hudl device is not being made any more so you can t replace it with a new one and this must be one of the reasons why you are not able to fix my Hudl  2 as you have no new parts to use.  I actually received a call this afternoon from you telling me to speak to Squaretrade (as I purchased an extended warranty with them).  This is despite the Hudl 2 being in warranty with you when it first went wrong.    I have tried to ring Square Trade but they are closed despite your member of staff and their website telling me they are open until 6pm today (Sunday 4th Sept).  I ve been a delivery saver customer since you introduced it and prior to that was a longstanding customer for many years shopping from home and also in your Tesco store in the citycentre and next to my old office.  I am really disappointed that you can t simply refund me my clubcard vouchers as I recently requested in my e-mail correspondence to you.   If you look back at my records  you will see just how much I have spent with you over the years.					2016-09-04T15:40:21+0000	1473003621	2016-09-04 17:40:21	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just thought i would send you a message on behalf of my parents regarding there traumatic ordeal that happened last night as they sat down for there evening meal  as my parents are not really up to date with technology they didnt think to take photos so i thought i would make you aware. Following a recent  purchase of your Fresh Tagliatelle Pasta to make an italian signature dish my Dad makes regularly  all fresh and prepared Dinner was served. To my mums suprise as shes about to take her first bite .... There was not one  but two Cigarette stumps in the Fresh Pasta 😲 a white one and a brown one!! Just  Wow!!!    My parents went to Tesco Leigh to make them aware ... they did nothing  not even an apology .... shocker!! 🙄   As they arent smokers themselves they didn t really appreciate the Dimps!  Worms in cucumbers  cigarette Stumps in Fresh Pasta ....  sort it out Tesco 👊					2016-09-04T14:16:15+0000	1472998575	2016-09-04 16:16:15	8	10	11	6	27	10	8	2	5	0	8	0	0	0	0	3	0

On 28/08/2016 I visited your store in Bradley Stoke to purchase a new top for an upcoming social event. Whilst trying this on in the fitting rooms my 8 year old son was sat just outside the door. I enlisted the help of 2 young members of staff for them to give me their opinion on which size looked better on me. Now I am not a small girl  I took a size 14 and 16 into the fitting room. The girls were friendly to my face and between us we decided the larger size fitted better.  Upon leaving the fitting room area with my son he became upset  started to cry  which is unusual for him. When I asked him what was wrong he told me that the girls on the fitting room were making fun of my size  gesturing to the fact that I am overweight and puffing out their cheeks etc whilst sniggering. As a mother I always try to instil in my son that although people come in different shapes and sizes  have different coloured skin and we don’t all look the same for him to be pleasant  nice and friendly to everyone. He couldn’t understand why these two adults could be so cruel. Upon paying for my new clothing the 2 girls had moved onto the till point. My 8 year old son then refused to come to the till with me and waited a little way back as he now viewed these people as “not nice” as they had made fun of his Mum and was a little bit scared of them. They spoke to me and said “oh  you decided to buy it then  it looked nice on you” it was at this point that I questioned them on their actions at the fitting room and told them that I was not happy that they had upset my son. Both understandably denied their actions  but I know that my son would not make this up and cry for no reason in the store. I am disgusted at their behaviour. Sometimes it can take a lot of courage for a larger person to go into a store and select new clothes  as a stockist of clothes up to a size 22 your staff should be more understanding of this. The psychological damage that can take place to a person after an experience like this could take years to recover from  or maybe it would deter people from shopping in store ever again. I am a reasonably strong person but still when I walked through the door at my home I burst into tears. These tears were not only for me but also for my little boy who should not be made to feel the way he was just by an innocent visit to one of your stores. I have the receipt for this purchase which I hope will provide the employee login for you to speak to the staff involved. I would ask that you advise them to be more courteous and understanding to ALL their customers regardless of their size. If by writing to you and you bringing the consequences of their actions to their attention it can save another person from suffering the humiliation that I was made to feel and to not have to explain to their children that some people in the world are not so understanding then this will be worth it.

Today I have spent half an hour of my time attempting to print pictures from your two photo kiosks only to be told that there is no ribbon left and after waiting fifteen minutes for assistance to then be told there is no one who can help! It s is ludicrous to me that you offer this service but that there is no one in your vast Tesco extra store who can replace the ribbon?! I would not be so irritated by this if this had been the first occurrence but this is the third time I have attempted to print pictures in your store to no avail. In future I will be making the longer drive to Asda and they can have my business instead. A very disgruntled customer.					2016-09-04T11:51:28+0000	1472989888	2016-09-04 13:51:28	1	3	1	0	4	3	2	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

She had other ID  including the card she used to purchase the phone plus her disabled Blue Badge.  I understand you might want ID  but not everyone has a passport and not everyone drives! How is this right?  Apparently this stipulation was made during the order process  but if it was it wasn t very clear.  She left without a phone  upset and annoyed. She now has to try to cancel the order and hope she gets her money back - absolutely ridiculous!					2016-09-04T11:42:24+0000	1472989344	2016-09-04 13:42:24	0	10	0	0	10	10	3	7	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

As a customer of Tesco for nearly 15 years I can honestly say I have never been so disapointed and angry as I am today! I normally go to a store in Bristol where everyone who works there is a credit always friendly and helpful... But this  manager  I spoke to this morning over the phone is a disgrace to the company!!!!! Again the operator I originally spoke to was a lovely lady who was so kind and helpful!!! I have now had to further my complaint to his manager as apparently no one higher works on a Sunday!?!?! Very Bad Tesco Very Bad!!!!   I don t think a glass table exploding infront of myself a 3 year old and an 8 month old is particularly acceptable....

Ok I get that home delivery has to cost more than Click N Collect  but now you offer CnC customers the ability to collect three hours after ordering.  Home delivery customers must change their order by 23:45 the night before delivery  meaning at least 8 hours prior to delivery.

I fail to understand why you weirdly stop stocking some of the most popular products in the UK! The last time this habit really affected our household was a couple of years back with what we refer to as  The Branston Beans Debacle . The 2nd most popular baked bean product across the UK gone from the shelf and not even so much as a warning. This left an entire half an isle full of Heinz and and Tesco s own variety. I ll let you into a secret though.......Heinz ain t all that great when it comes to Beans!    Anyhow  we now find ourselves in another quandary. Since January my wife and I became vegan. Besides the fact we love telling people this we also enjoy giving our opinions of what people should sell in supermarkets  restaurants  etc. We actually have become great at cooking from fresh  meal planning and trying new recipes. We are also much healthier by default. This new problem however comes from Tesco s reluctance to stock an essential ingredient from our day to day life. Breakfasts  hot drinks  deserts  soups  ice creams are but a few of the things we use Alpro Vanilla for and just simply taking it off the shelf is far from helpful. As I m sure you are aware shopping for vegan products can be quite tricky enough without removing the integral parts from our culinary capabilities. I m certain the person that made this decision was not vegan. While on the subject can I also inform you that since 2006 there has been a rise in people over the age of 16 becoming vegan by a massive 360% (may something for the marketing team to think about).  I understand little of how companies like Tesco s move products around with stock level charts and such  but I do think that in cases like these you should certainly think of smaller groups of customers. I was told yesterday to try another name supermarket for the Alpro vanilla but what on earth is the point of shopping under one roof to have to go somewhere else for another product. Surely it would be easier to go elsewhere for everything. Not a threat btw.   Please release Alpro Vanilla 1 litre back onto the shelf!

As usual no text or phone contact made. As usual I rang customer service to complain. The man I spoke to was defensive from the start  stating that unless the store lets them know they can t call customers. Maybe  but surely that is something to take up with the  store and not an excuse. The conversation continued in this fashion with him eventually asking me what I thought he should do. I suggested that Tesco investigate why the service from Gallions Reach is so poor and he said that there was nothing they could do if people don t want to turn up to work or do the job  short of rewinding 100 years and whipping people! ! I don t think this is an acceptable way to speak to a customer and would suggest that if your calls are recorded for training purposes  that you find this conversation and use it to show how not to deal with complaints! The home delivery service is failing at this particular store - Tesco need to sort it out quickly as I m sure I m not the only one considering a change of supermarket.					2016-09-04T06:33:24+0000	1472970804	2016-09-04 08:33:24	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It is difficult enough at Tesco Kettering as there are hardly any spaces in the parent and child area as it is without ignorant people parking there who don t have their children with them. Does anyone check these spaces ?? Also  will there be any more spaces added for parents  with children as I always struggle to park there as they are normally taken. They do not need to be right outside the doors  I can walk with my child  we just need spaces with extra door room to make it easier to get the children in and out of the car.

The toilets were absolutely disgusting!!    When I went to complain we was told by the security guard that all management had finished for the night so we wasn t able to make a complaint.  A member of staff that was passing said the toilets  should  have been closed as there was no cleaners in.  There was a make shift door handle made from rope and gaffer tape  there was no toilet paper  the was faeces all over the toilet bowl and the smell was horrendous.   Is this how tesco treat theur paying customers??  This isn t the first time we have complained about the facilities. My partner (who is disabled)  complained a couple of months back to the manager to be told  it s not my problem!! .   Beyond disgusting   I most definitely will not be shopping at tesco again.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14184334_10154360023371427_862775483642916226_n.jpg?oh=a1c9c18662925c69c33e6e1bdb51420c&oe=58D667DC	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14184334_10154360023371427_862775483642916226_n.jpg?oh=9e80bcce4ca36e52de277924d1994c60&oe=58E12CC9	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154360023371427&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-03T21:20:16+0000	1472937616	2016-09-03 23:20:16	0	13	3	1	17	12	9	3	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	2	0

The staff at the orphanage  (where this little girly is currently living at) went around asking all the kids to write down there greatest dreams/wishes . Once all the information was successful collected  it got posted on line in order to see if anyone could assist in making these dreams come true.  There fore I would like to ask you  if it is in your power  would you please be so kind and help me make one little girls dream come true by either providing me with vouchers to alowe me tu purchase this item at a reduced price or even  donating a dolly house to this wonderful cause ( I understand that it is not a very expensive item but the less I have to spend the more dreams may come true as then I could use that money to go towards another wish )  Thank you very much for taking your time to read this and hope to hear from you soon.   Remember - Every little helps and this time it would really  mean a lot :)  Kind regards   Zara Brencs	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14192567_10209612474011744_2378508474518092509_n.jpg?oh=f75aaec269146df97206a9940c6b4665&oe=591D25CB	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14192567_10209612474011744_2378508474518092509_n.jpg?oh=6e10afbb0d8b41b31857940aa00223e7&oe=591B04C6	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209612474011744&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-03T20:47:22+0000	1472935642	2016-09-03 22:47:22	1	2	1	0	3	2	2	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

We travelled to York to visit a different shop.   Much to our disappointment they were closed when we got there. So never mind  we said we would pop and get some milk and school uniform.  Wandering round the shop  my fiancé pushing the pram  me a trolley  as let s face it  milk and school uniform means we will take half the shop away with us!  Our son decides he is hungry  he s only young  and I ll be honest very spoilt as he s had a rough start to his little life at only 16 months old  5 anaphylactic reactions to date.  Anyway  can you imagine the stares from disapproving people as we are trying to keep him quiet  and him having none of it  shouting for food from the shelf. So we split up  this time me with trolley  so I could look disapprovingly at the fiancé pretending the little boy who is screaming isn t mine (come on if your a parent you have to admit you ve done this before).  Great a multipack of Pom Bears  I grab them  then find the fiancé (which wasn t difficult  I followed the noise!)   So I rip open the packet and give him some...... Silence  and the cute smiling baby was back.  We carried on round the store  staff were helpful  and polite  off we went to pay for our trolley full of shopping  luckily we did scan as you shop so checkout was painless  apart from of course the handing over the money part... That s never easy!  Then the serious part comes  our son  who if you remember has serious allergies  started with blotches appearing on his face  and within seconds his lips were bright red  and he started chocking. This is his anaphylactic symptoms  so we started working our first aid on him  oblivious to anyone or anything around us.  That was until a lady very loudly said   look what she s doing to that child  (he was chocking  so granted he was tilted upside down while I was smacking his back) until then she saw something come out of him onto the floor.... This is where I apologise  we didn t clean it nor inform anyone!   The lady then realised I wasn t beating our son for no reason  and offered help and support... Your staff were oblivious at the time! He then went floppy and unresponsive for only seconds but of course that feels like a lifetime!  My fiancé ran to the car to get his epi pens  my 9 year old daughter followed my instructions to get a bottle of water without paying for it (after a little panic about the security guard sending her to prison) and I gave inhalers and piriton!  After all this we really hadn t noticed anyone around us  and were just doing what we could for our son. We spoke to a member of staff explaining we would go and pay for the water once he was sorted  this member of staff was rude and ignored us  while looking directly at us  never mind... Another member of the team made up for his rudeness  telling us to get anything we needed for our son and nothing was too much trouble  after everything  and by now our son was running around  I went to pay for the water  we were offered a first aider  which we politely declined  obviously he s walking  drinking and eating so fine :)   So I d like to compliment the staff who were kind enough to support and help us  and the customer for stopping to check WE were okay (it shakes you up a little dealing with that)   But most of all I d like an answer to how I spent £54 and forgot the bloody milk???					2016-09-03T20:44:21+0000	1472935461	2016-09-03 22:44:21	10	6	12	2	20	6	4	2	2	0	10	0	2	0	0	0	0

I had a delivery booked between 7-8 which did not arrive. When I phoned to see what had happened they told me that the reason they had not contacted me to tell me my shopping would not be delivered was because they are not allowed to contact customers incase to worry them????? The whole point of home delivery is it fits around the customers life so now I am left with no shopping and hungry children. I was then told I could only have half my delivery charge refunded?????? Really???? You haven t delivered when required (Apparently the delivery driver was refusing to come up stairs when I have a lift??surely this is something the delivery coordinator should allow for) the customer service person also admitted that the delivery driver should not be working as he is not for to work yet he is out delivering???? So having had no delivery  no communication  having to ring around myself to find out where the shopping is and having to go out at 9pm to get my very hungry children dinner because I had no prior warning a customer services manager wants to offer me £9 goodwill gesture???? I ve had nothing but hassle this evening with it and on top of I ve had to drag the kids out at 9pm to get them dinner of which cost I was not expecting. For them to offer £9 is appalling and quite frankly no understanding of how much inconvenience they have cause tonight. Poor management of the delivery depot and poor customer service team which are clearly just trying to meet targets rather than offer customer service. Needless to say I have cancelled my monthly direct debit delivery that I pay as tescos have failed to make me see that they actually value their customers! I ve had to fork out over 20 pounds tonight which I was not expecting to do so and when living on a tight budget this is not on because tesco can t deliver or communicate but apparently they apologise??? Sometimes a sorry just isn t enough when so much disruption is caused to a family and unnecessary costs. I m now having to wait up till 10.30 for my shopping to be delivered...... unacceptable!!!!					2016-09-03T20:31:24+0000	1472934684	2016-09-03 22:31:24	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have shopped at Tesco for 25 years. I buy all of our groceries and use tesco fuel. I do as much Christmas shopping as possible at tesco and regularly buy clothes for the family. Every year we use our points to purchase merlin annual passes. Last year  I found that I had to upgrade these passes at a cost of £50 each to avoid restricted dates. In the past  we have used the vouchers for holidays  paying the TOTAL cost at Siblu and Haven with vouchers. I have just been through the clubcard website to see what I can spend some vouchers on before they expire. You can no longer pay for the total cost of a holiday with vouchers - it seems there are very little places you can pay the total cost with vouchers. Very disappointed Tesco. :(					2016-09-03T20:10:14+0000	1472933414	2016-09-03 22:10:14	1	11	1	0	12	1	1	0	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

As you can see its still in date #8ThSeptember2016 just went into the scullery   prepped my tuna mayo ( also purchased from tesco as im a Tesco loyal ) went into the bread bin and find my baguettes covered in a hair like substance longer than my own! Dont know if i need a barber or a fumigation of my cupboards. Called the store as i cant get out to my local store at present ( shettleston ) and not much has been done about this situation. I would like some assistance asap thanks to resolve this matter. Im now left with a bowl of tuna mayo just sitting there staring at me.

I usually have my bubba in his carrier and so can be a mission to unload one of your big trollies but I have always been offered help  even by management! Yet Asda watched me struggle to the point even a customer offered me help!

I ve used Tesco delivery for years & always been a huge fan but the Erith depot are awful...& it seems to be getting worse. When it came out of Aylesford it was so much better.   Always numerous substitutions (some that are often ridiculous) & often late (although this late is a first!).   Had you not already taken payment from my card when you text me at 10am I would have cancelled it & gone & done it myself. At least then I may have been able to have lunch!  However  despite the delivery driver clearly not having a good day he still delivered it with a smile! Please thank him.					2016-09-03T16:03:24+0000	1472918604	2016-09-03 18:03:24	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I ordered 2 Sistema Quad lunchboxes from you on Thursday to be delivered on Friday  1 blue and 1 purple. But with no indication of a substitution on the delivery note  2 blue lunchboxes were delivered. The delivery guy (can t remember his name) checked his system and could see that the purple one had been substituted so he apologised and I sent it back. Once he got back in the van he rang his team to try and get a new one sent out to me. They rang me to apologise again and say that they were out of stock of all but the blue and offered me a different substitute. As you will know if you have more than one child  all has to be fair and the same so I thanked the customer service lady and said no thank you. So I looked round various shops and eventually found a pink Sistema Quad lunchbox in another shop. Brought it home and showed my 2 children their new lunchbox. The 5 year old opened his blue one up and snap! It broke. So I phoned customer services. Close to nervous breakdown about the lunchbox saga and told Emma my tale of woe. After keeping me on hold for 2 minutes she said she would see what she could do and she would call me back. Sure enough  10 minutes later she called to say they were out of stock but were due a delivery tonight. Ordered me a blue lunchbox to be delivered tomorrow and sent me a £5 voucher as a goodwill gesture for all the time it had taken me. And that is how you do customer service Tesco. Well done!					2016-09-03T15:48:47+0000	1472917727	2016-09-03 17:48:47	2	4	2	0	6	4	1	3	0	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

Phoned Tesco mobile with regard to an upgrade and was informed 2 days later he would receive his new handset. After 2 weeks  1 phone call and 1 email later still no handset. A phone call to customer services informed me that the handset has been discontinued my only option was to change the handset or cancel the upgrade. No offer of good-will or even explanation as to why I was having to chase the issue  Most disappointed.					2016-09-03T15:45:16+0000	1472917516	2016-09-03 17:45:16	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I shop at the Catterick garrison shop and have a blue badge  however I find it near to impossible to park in a blue badge bay as 90% of the time fit young soldiers park in these bays.  I have spoken to the soldiers and either get an embarrassed response  but they do not move or I receive abuse from them. I have contacted the store on numerous occasions.  They say they are unable to do anything about it  why?   If one tesco store can take action why can t the Catterick branch.   Smells of apathy to me and an uncaring store.					2016-09-03T15:36:34+0000	1472916994	2016-09-03 17:36:34	0	8	0	0	8	8	4	4	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have been a Tesco shopper since 1991 and I use to enjoy wandering round the Megastore in Bristol near my old house. Since 1999 I moved to Dorset  Dorchester to be precise. We have a very small store  which I had to campaign to get a 500 ream of paper on the shelves for me to buy; as it was an item the couldn t sell in Dorchester? I started taxing in 2001 to support my way through Bournemouth University. As a taxi driver I probably visit Gatwick about 10-15 times a month. In 2009 I discovered a mega store at Gatwick; I was absolutely delighted as it meant I could browse the Megastores again without having to go to far out of my way. I don t go to the store every time as I have a 3hr drive back to work. When I do go sometimes I get there early in the morning and I go and have breakfast then I phone my partner to make sure there hasn t been any urgent bookings; if there has I usually return back to Dorset  if there hasn t I normally spend an hour or two looking at the electronics department  stationary department  Xbox games. Recently in June after I got married we had some money to spend on gifts. I visited the Gatwick store; after I dropped off  to have a study of the smart TVs  as Curry has one on offer for £245. Two and a half to three weeks later I received a £70 parking fine in the post  reduced to £40 if I paid within 14 days.  My favourite megastore for the last seven years has suddenly got a rule that no taxis are allowed to park or wait in the car park! I tried ringing customer service  was told to go to the store in question  visited the Gatwick store  was told by the duty manager I had to go to the horizon parking company that fined me. After appealing with proof of receipts that I have been in the store  and asking why as a customer with no other vehicle to use other than a taxi  how was I supposed to visit the store? That Tesco or Horizon parking have not made provision to be able to apply for an exemptions certificate like I do with my local council to be able to use my local tip. Means I have lost the right to use this store due to horrible persons in the trade that use the store car park as a toilet  and use the parking bays as a waiting area waiting for jobs from their head office s. I think I might be shopping elsewhere from now on  I can t afford £40 every time I want to have a good look at all the products the do! I will especially start boycotting shops using these parking companies to fine third shoppers  2hrs is not enough time. Your the ones making your store like mini mall s! Stop trying to make us rush.					2016-09-03T15:18:54+0000	1472915934	2016-09-03 17:18:54	0	12	1	0	13	11	3	8	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I did this today  as it was the first opportunity to do so. I went back to the phone shop  where the Customer Advisor tried to sell me another cable (cheaper than the one i bought) I explained i was not paying for a new cable I wanted an exchange. She told me to come back and see the Customer Advisor that had served me in first place.  and by the way there was no word of any report  she did tell me to contact the manufacturer myself....I walked away disgusted 					2016-09-03T15:18:09+0000	1472915889	2016-09-03 17:18:09	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

These should be recalled .	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14184433_10157520846125106_7463416612726375075_n.jpg?oh=76402784bcb05398c535a2344bb0430b&oe=58E40B9F	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14184433_10157520846125106_7463416612726375075_n.jpg?oh=4d77b5f64d34072bdfd041aac156a9ad&oe=59225392	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157520846125106&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-03T15:05:04+0000	1472915104	2016-09-03 17:05:04	8	15	8	0	23	15	2	13	5	0	8	0	0	0	0	0	0

We eventually found some she liked in the right size so she tried the shoe on. As she put her foot the shoe she very quickly snatched it away saying something had stabbed the bottom of her foot. When I looked in the shoe I found the piece of security tag in there. It had cut the bottom of my daughter s foot. We put the shoes back straight away  went to pay for our food shopping and left the store. I m only glad my daughter was old enough to know something was not right and pull the shoe off  it she had been younger it could have been a lot worse!!!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14183938_10157394421915182_5820170872486596409_n.jpg?oh=68e6d33cfaeed0c2a59d194def037fa4&oe=58EEF3CF	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14183938_10157394421915182_5820170872486596409_n.jpg?oh=e06ca3dc44fc521f6e0df2a738ab8b13&oe=5919A2C2	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157394421915182&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-03T13:14:24+0000	1472908464	2016-09-03 15:14:24	0	10	0	0	10	10	5	5	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Being confronted at my local tesco by badger cull protested is in acceptable. Allowing them to block doors and walkways when people just want to do there shopping is giving you the reputation that you  as an organisation are against the cull. Which if you are you will certainly loose custom. Maybe next week pro badger cull campaigners could do the same??					2016-09-03T11:47:58+0000	1472903278	2016-09-03 13:47:58	1	7	1	0	8	6	3	3	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Whilst in the fresh produce section there were two members of staff clearly picking produce for online shoppers. One made a comment  well I haven t got to eat it so in it goes  as she tossed some fruit into a brown paper bag. The other member of staff complained that if customers only wanted green bananas they should get of their backsides and come to the shop themselves. Whilst I appreciate that we have bad days at work in a customer service role your team members should at the very least be professional especially when carrying out a service for paying customers on behalf of Tesco. I did inform the customer service desk who were going to pass my comments on.					2016-09-03T08:12:32+0000	1472890352	2016-09-03 10:12:32	6	5	8	3	16	5	4	1	1	0	5	0	0	1	0	1	0

This is the third delivery where I have received off food. Its nice that you refund the cost but it doesn t help that I then have to drive into town to replace them.

I then received a crappy automated email to say that my order could not be completed on the 03/09/16 and my money would be refunded (5 to 6 working days). No explanation given and very little in the way of an apology. I cannot begin to tell you how upsetting this is and it is a real display of the poor levels of customer service from Tesco. No only am I deeply disappointed that the sofa I wanted was not available (I spent a long time finding this product). If a product is not available you should not take the customer’s money in the 1st place  then to make them wait 6 days to get their money back is shocking. I am now left upset that my sofa is not available and unable to buy an alternative. This really puts me off shopping with Tesco and I am not sure I would even buy my groceries from you.					2016-09-03T08:03:50+0000	1472889830	2016-09-03 10:03:50	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My mum had to park away at the top end of the carpark. She has mobility problems and should not have had to park away at the backmof beyond to get to the store.   I asked customer service if there was anything that could be done and she told me  no its not a tesco carpark so we cant do anything  - but hold on a minute.... my dad parked in a parent child space not so long ago and his car registration plate was read over the tanoid to go to customer services. When he got there he was verbally forced to move his car to another space. So why wasnt the same done for my mums needs when she has mobility problems and needed a space close to the store instead of being like i said away at the back of beyond of the car park. Surely its not one rule for one and one rule for another Tesco.   Can someone please clarify for me please					2016-09-03T07:57:56+0000	1472889476	2016-09-03 09:57:56	1	8	1	0	9	8	5	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Anywho  2 out of 3 children in bed and baby settled after nearly 2hrs  husband out and I suddenly remember I have a packet of scones in the bread bin and my posh strawberry jam and clotted cream in the fridge - result! I make a cuppa  bit milkier than usual but I ll go with it as it s probably gonna be the hottest one I m going to drink all day. Getting quite excited now  this treat will go down nicely...hear baby stirring but pretty sure she will settle again...open the packet of scones to be greeted by blue mould on 5 out of 6 of them. I wonder if this is karma for slating The Great British Bake Off on Wednesday. Gutted. Can t bring myself to eat the non mouldy one. Oh  and the baby didn t settle again so I m pinned to the sofa with my mug of tea just out of reach and no sodding scones!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14192737_10157301255450580_6741391729552731865_n.jpg?oh=5f2f7632a02eded907bdc43c13a57d90&oe=591F5A5A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14192737_10157301255450580_6741391729552731865_n.jpg?oh=8e2f017e4880c3320656bab436f752af&oe=5918FB57	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157301255450580&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-02T21:06:41+0000	1472850401	2016-09-02 23:06:41	4	8	5	0	13	8	7	1	4	0	4	0	0	1	0	0	0

Once again I go down the gluten free freezer aisle to grab my favourite treat dinner (sweet n sour chicken balls) only to find it gone again. No price tag on the shelf. Could you tell me where it s gone  this happened earlier this year and then came back so I stocked up  now I ve ran out and it s now no longer available online or in store.					2016-09-02T21:01:04+0000	1472850064	2016-09-02 23:01:04	0	9	0	0	9	9	2	7	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I just had my home delivery arrive from the Glasgow  Dalmarnock Road store for the delivery slot 21:00-22:00.  I am not here to complain  the complete opposite in fact!!!  The driver that brought our shopping in was the politest  most well presented member of dot com staff I have ever seen!  He kindly brought our massive shop to the door and into our kitchen and even helped unload the boxes onto the worktops! He asked us what we had been upto today  we had a chat about some games we were playing and he bid us goodnight.  THE MOST AWESOME delivery guy ever!  This guy (whos name I do not know) deserves some recognition!  PLEASE pass on my compliments to the dot com manager/DM of the store for this man  no doubt they can trace who the driver was for the time slot and post code.					2016-09-02T20:55:14+0000	1472849714	2016-09-02 22:55:14	1	2	1	0	3	2	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I am disabled with multiple fractures in my spine.  I need to use the disabled toilet.  The condition was beyond horrific.  The floor was filthy plus soaking wet.  All toilet paper was soaking wet.  There was blood in the toilet.  Plus the seat was soaked.  never had no choice but to sit on the seat as it s the only toilet with rails.  As there was no dry paper I had to get wet with somebody s body fluids. Thankful when I got in and could shower.   Spoke to the lady in the restaurant and she had called the cleaner 4 times.  No one arrive. I spoke to a member of staff and she could not of cared.   I would have slipped in that toilet. I would have taken you for all you have. As a fall means fractures.  If I ever see it in the mess like it was today. I will send these pictures to the papers.  This is beyond revolting.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14199345_10210390525750455_8331652220701102673_n.jpg?oh=65c25f416f88362dad04d0ed976f97b8&oe=58D66CC3	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14199345_10210390525750455_8331652220701102673_n.jpg?oh=8c5ded29f4dd2bf434ee3ffbad73c04e&oe=592202CE	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10210390525750455&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-02T20:13:55+0000	1472847235	2016-09-02 22:13:55	0	5	1	0	6	5	2	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

Only had the tablet 1 month only been charged three times after being on charge 4-5 hours only has 30ish minutes of charge in it on 3rd charge it doesn t even recognise it is plugged in and won t charge at all. Contacted Tesco who said it is covered on the warranty but needs to be sent to manufacturer which I have done who want to charge me £120 for a new charger port cause it s  damaged  told them I m not paying that. Contacted Tesco again who have said tough there is nothing they can do and I should have sent the tablet back sooner.

Best before dates will be removed in the not too distant future as food that still can be consumed is put to waste and can burn a hole in your pocket.

We have one from a couple of years ago that doesn t have a gender specific label. I just don t understand what purpose it serves.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14232460_10154032186978802_6668949695152281285_n.jpg?oh=5610aac753e8e0d887e8d1dce5451cbc&oe=59247FF8	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14232460_10154032186978802_6668949695152281285_n.jpg?oh=857e11c4abdfed8f30bccb7a7bd3e739&oe=58E509F5	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154032186978802&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-02T14:27:21+0000	1472826441	2016-09-02 16:27:21	6	2	6	1	9	2	2	0	1	0	6	0	0	0	0	0	0

I would like to put in a note of positive recognition for a member of your staff.  I almost fainted in store today and I was really looked after by your shop assistant Diane in your Newtonhill store. She calmed me down when I felt dizzy and afraid got someone to fetch me water  then when I was well enough to get up she was so kind to assist me at the checkout and saw me out safely.  I can t thank her enough.  Need more people like this in the world 💙					2016-09-02T14:22:33+0000	1472826153	2016-09-02 16:22:33	14	5	14	0	19	5	4	1	2	0	12	0	0	0	0	0	0

Me & my family have been shopping at your store for years buying the daily essentials   electrical goods etc.   How I was confronted the other night by your security guard was pathetic. Don t want to go into too much detail but it s on CCTV & hopefully you have sound on your CCTV & it will blatantly indicate how unprofessional your security guard was.   I have logged a complaint ... to which I spoke to the security manager of the particular Tesco s store (Leigh). The security manager explained  I shall get back in contact with you today or tomorrow. This was Wednesday 30/08/2016   I have emailed Tesco s via Twitter & as you can see it s been outlined that  Lindsay the security manager has been trying to contact you but the call went to voicemail .   if that s the case why not leave a voicemail ?  Hi Martin  Lindsay here from Tesco s Leigh please could you contact me back on this number . Lindsay is obviously telling blatant lies.   Obviously me & my family will be using our custom elsewhere.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14203097_1744694419151823_8515753602959986761_n.jpg?oh=8231cd57ed090590708ee546f07049ff&oe=5923D618	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/14203097_1744694419151823_8515753602959986761_n.jpg?oh=a5408c0e2cf95ff9a2098a8ed78ee73d&oe=58E72773	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1744694419151823&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-02T14:16:00+0000	1472825760	2016-09-02 16:16:00	1	6	2	0	8	5	4	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

Our visit today started as most normal visits do with our 7 year old going to look at the PS3 controllers all summer holidays he has been doing little jobs for money to buy himself a new one(he had to buy his own as he only wanted a new one because it looked cool!) and every time he makes sure you still have the £19 pdp afterglow wireless ones! Today he finally had £19 so looked at them and chose the one that glows blue(the choice was blue or red) we pay but are charged £20 he gets a little worried as he only has £19 but we tell him it s ok we will go to costumer services to get them to check the price the lady happily hose to check the item and the price comes back and says that the product didn t match the item barcode for the price but she offered to take us to the technology desk to see if they had any £19 ones left  hubby our son go with her whilst I go to see if paying the £1 extra might mean a better controller. I am looking at all the PS3 controllers and not one is priced at £20 as I m looking another member of staff asks if I m the one complaining that the controller is in the wrong place? I say not complaining just wanting to see the difference she then shows me an xbox360 controller I say we don t want an Xbox but a PS3 controller for her to say you picked £20 one not £19 customers are always moving things and blaming us I try to explain that I m not blaming anyone and I would like her to show me the £20 ones so I can compare them to the £19 ones as I m talking my husband the first customer services lady and another staff member join us the member of staff I m talking with and the new member of staff start complaining about customers moving things and then complaining they are being over charged again I ask to be shown the £20 ones again I was shown an Xbox controller first customer service lady says no where are these controllers(she has the one we had picked in her hand) for the other staff members to say they have no idea they must have been controllers that had been returned and have been put out with the £19 ones as they have no price tag for them only Xbox ones and we should have looked at the barcode numbers on item and the price ticket before we payed when I asked how I would know the price I got told you would know when you payed it s only a pound so what s the fuss? The only difference was the colour the controller glowed(red was £19 blue was £20) so I ask if we could be refunded for the blue and get the red(why pay just for a different colour?)First Lady say yes other ladies take the £20 ones and put them back with the £19 ones when I say don t you think you should move them or price them up properly they said no as they wouldn t have the price code anymore for just two items and if anyone complained they would just say customers have moved them!					2016-09-02T13:45:45+0000	1472823945	2016-09-02 15:45:45	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Every time the only parent and children parking spaces available are in front of Costa which is no problem. The problem is that every time there is only 1 trolley with the shelf for the infant car seat. And this trolley is filthy. The handle is covered in greyish black sticky stuff which is revolting  especially as you touch the trolley and then groceries or your baby.  I was just stop going to Tesco (at least until my daughter is old enough to sit in a normal trolley - I wouldn t put my daughter in the blue hard seats for babies as she is in a harness for hip problems). Then your employee Philip ( I think he is a  trolley manager ) approached me when I left the shop and offered to help me with putting my shopping in the boot  opening the doors so I could put the car seat in easier and return the trolley for me. I never experienced such helpful behaviour in a supermarket before. I just wish you would sort out the trolley situation.					2016-09-02T13:38:12+0000	1472823492	2016-09-02 15:38:12	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

My elderly mum went in to the changing rooms today to try a few items on as its her birthday  she suffers with various health problems so her mobility and breathing aren t the best. At one point she realised she needed some help so pressed the buzzer but ended up slipping and banging her head. No one came so she managed to open the door to see the staff members too busy singing and dancing. She eventually managed to get herself up and once out she told them she had pressed the button but was advised it s not even working! She could have seriously hurt herself and no one would have even noticed! They didn t seem to care about what had happened either. Really disappointed and so is she. It s put a downer on her birthday now :(					2016-09-02T13:24:23+0000	1472822663	2016-09-02 15:24:23	0	5	2	0	7	5	5	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0

When I queried it I was told that the prices on the handset don t always update and that those prices are only a guide anyway  so it s tough! Pay the higher price or go away was the message from your staff. APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE!					2016-09-02T13:10:49+0000	1472821849	2016-09-02 15:10:49	3	6	5	0	11	6	1	5	0	0	3	0	2	0	0	0	0

I rely on my delivery and find it marvellous.  This week knowing I only had a certain amount to spend I kept my order to about £2 less than I had available. Tesco has just rung to say my bank refused to pay and that they (Tesco) were unable to take an item off the order to reduce the cost. Which annoyingly was only 16p more than I had. I didn t think to ask if I could have paid the driver when he arrived  would this have been a option?					2016-09-02T12:43:44+0000	1472820224	2016-09-02 14:43:44	0	5	0	0	5	4	3	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I appreciate veg has to grow outside and there will be things every so often. But to be blue???? They re more blue than green so don t even look like baby caterpillars. 4 in the picture  more in the other bits of cauliflower i broke up...the one on the chopping board was alive. Couple more too. Last week I threw a broccoli away with white bugs like this. Thought it was a one off and didn t complain. The cauliflower even looks slightly blue when you get in it more.

Iceberg lettuce  potatoes  cucumber amongst many other fruit and veg with a best before date of today (2nd September) no other choice of dates on the shelf and  when I asked  no other dates available. The person who I spoke to could not give me an explanation as to why  on a Friday  there was little fruit and veg which would have latest until the weekend!  I don t know  was all he could offer!!! Maybe as they are an isolated  small town store they think the customer won t/cannot go elsewhere. Sadly Tesco you have lost one customer.					2016-09-02T10:02:41+0000	1472810561	2016-09-02 12:02:41	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It s a day and age where we never have to let people wonder what is happening or where we are. We have everything from good old phone calls to text  email  FaceTime  Skype  Facebook and Twitter.  Yet I am amazed that tesco seem to be unable to effectively use any of these forms of communication. I am wondering why I was sat up till midnight last night waiting for a food order that should have arrived between 10-11pm but never came. I waited till midnight on the chance that my driver was delayed and that he would be doing his best to get to me  that if my food was not coming someone would have had to good grace to have used one of these forms of communication to tell me.  Today I picked up the phone (that classic form of communication) to find out what happened. Apparently an accident MUCH earlier in the day had meant the driver didn t have time to complete his orders. Again this is where I am confused  an accident much earlier in the day meaning they had plenty of notice to grab one of those forms of communication and stop me sitting up till midnight waiting. But no call  no text  no email!  So disappointed in the awful customer service and I am amazed at the lack of consideration to your customers.					2016-09-02T09:36:29+0000	1472808989	2016-09-02 11:36:29	1	4	2	0	6	4	3	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0

The staff deal with this and never have I seen anyone be thrown out for putting their items on a till. Today a lovely black gent and his lady were in your store. As the till wasn t free because someone was being served he put his items on the till next to it. No issue. Seen it many  many times. However your staff member seemed to take great offence to this and looked the chap up and down before raising his voice rudely telling him to  back off.  Trés professional. The customer simply said  please don t be rude to me. I ve done nothing wrong.  Security was called and the couple were asked to leave. Now  I d usually just assume that the staff member in question was just an idiot  but I ve seen the same guy deal with problem customers and druggies with more respect and courtesy. A few minutes before this another black chap was having an issue on self service and the way the same staff member spoke to him was simply disgusting. I go into this store on almost a daily basis and while I ve made many comments to my partner about this staff member being rude  this was way too far and I believe it was a personal issue the staff member has. Maybe an  are you a horrendous racist?  Test should be taken before hiring in your stores?					2016-09-02T08:37:59+0000	1472805479	2016-09-02 10:37:59	0	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

I purchased a tablet for my daughter in October last year . The tablet I purchased has now stopped charging. We have the receipt as proof of purchase and the receipt clearly states on the receipt that there is a guarantee for 1 year. We have been down to tesco to get this sorted to be told as after 30 days we have to go direct to asus. I was not happy about this as we go the tablet from you. If I d have bought it from anywhere else I would have taken it back to them why are you so different just because it s not one of your products? I have now wasted time and money ringing asus direct and my daughter is still without her tablet! We have been asked by asus for the serial number which we do not have( it s only on the box apparently which we kept for 3 months and then threw it) it s not on the receipt nor the tablet itself . They don t seem to believe us and so said they will send us an email so we can take a picture of our receipt and send it back before they will send out something in the post to get the tablet for a repair?! They also cannot speak English very well which is causing another issue ( don t mean to be rude but it s a fact) I have been waiting for this email to come and have had nothing so have just called them yet again to be told they don t send emails!!!!? The person we spoke to today tried fobbing us off yet again saying we need serial number we asked to speak to someone in authority and was told we have to email? ( they had just said don t do emails) all I want is for this to be resolved and for my daughter to have a working tablet especially as she s going back to school on Monday! I am very annoyed at tesco lack of customer service here as we purchased it from you and I feel you should be dealing with this regardless of who the tablet was made by! We have a useless product and are still no where near resolving this nearly 2 weeks on!					2016-09-02T08:26:49+0000	1472804809	2016-09-02 10:26:49	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I was in your Church Street  Manchester Express Store last night at 9:57pm (a full hour before your store closes) and witnessed a member of staff emptying the bakery section into a black bin liner.  Firstly  I want to ask why this was being done a full hour before closing? I was under the impression that  as a brand trying to revive both its fortunes and public image  you were trying to heavily reduce food waste? If this practice is being repeated across your 6 500+ stores that s a hell of a lot of perfectly edible food going to waste. Surely it makes more sense to bag the loose items and reduce them in price  much like a retailer such as Waitrose does?  Secondly  I have witnessed this happening quite a few times at this store (sometimes as early as two hours before closing) and it often appears there is substantial amount. If you really find it necessary to clean the bakery section way before the store closes  could you not offer a local charity working with the homeless the option to collect the unsold items each night? Here in Manchester there are various charities across the city helping to feed rough sleepers every single night.  Lastly  it appears cleaning this area takes very little time  so why do it so early?! I ve been offered the explanation on Twitter that it s  managers discretion  - this action is hardly customer or community focused  so maybe this discretion is uncalled for?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14142060_10157352154740557_7525508882738007693_n.jpg?oh=3028137de7bd6873f93bf682c3fcd0b6&oe=58DF8553	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14142060_10157352154740557_7525508882738007693_n.jpg?oh=77b5f26e6c992bd20f46db577ec61069&oe=58EA1B5E	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157352154740557&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-02T07:38:13+0000	1472801893	2016-09-02 09:38:13	1	2	2	0	4	2	2	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0

After being directed to the company I have been ignored by them and told they will not take responsibility. I have just left a review to warn others and now you have removed it saying it can t be posted. I was restrained and factual. This is completely unfair. I have always shopped with Tesco and been completely loyal but this treatment is disgusting and I will be taking my business else where!					2016-09-01T20:53:16+0000	1472763196	2016-09-01 22:53:16	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The problem was it was amongst all of the remaining strawberries so I had to throw away the lot. As you are aware strawberries are not very cheap to buy so I was quite upset to throw away almost half a pack. I understand the use by date was yesterday but I don t expect them to go mouldy that quickly!  I am informing you in case you need to review the use by dates on your strawberries as this was not very nice for me to experience.  I have attached photos of proof.

Where am i to park safely to transfer my child since we ate the one of thousands who do not qualify for a blue badge?  Are you planning to change the signs to parent and toddler since you deem that any young person over 5 yrs old no longer warrants the safety of a larger space  do you have a different classification on the term child to the rest of the world?  Tesco not making it easier for parents with children over the age of 5 or the sn community! Attached is a picture from another article showing one of your new signs in The parkway centre Coulby Newham. With the lovely term too of  so much easier to shop from home   and your website  Maybe you just dont want us shopping in your stores anymore!	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14212713_10209698667201549_7979913060881845152_n.jpg?oh=99f9c242e5357e56ba6ec431a3c07d5a&oe=58DC9E9A	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14212713_10209698667201549_7979913060881845152_n.jpg?oh=91e6d238191f366da7f7a3c4312c3663&oe=58F00397	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209698667201549&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-01T18:33:51+0000	1472754831	2016-09-01 20:33:51	4	15	4	0	19	2	2	0	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I use to think you was a good business  fair to your customers. But now with recent addition of deciding to charge your loyal customers for click and collect deliveries  is some what ridiculous. The charge could make a item of clothing double the price.  Ever little helps  I think not! It s only helping you claw back some of the revenue you have lost out on   from the cut price supermarkets. Why do you think customers are going there  it s cheaper and your getting a better service. Perhaps you should focus more on your customer basis  than you dividends for your share holders. Else you might not have allot to pay them in the future.					2016-09-01T18:29:44+0000	1472754584	2016-09-01 20:29:44	1	11	1	1	13	9	3	6	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

There wasn t enough stock so I planned to drive to a bigger store. To find that my tyre had been stabbed and was almost flat while parked in your car park. Much later still no uniform but finally a repaired tyre. I know this is not a direct fault of Tesco. But not nice during my visit.					2016-09-01T18:00:54+0000	1472752854	2016-09-01 20:00:54	0	5	0	0	5	3	2	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Firstly  cutting the trees back would be ineffective  and is not tackling the problem.... So  to recap. Earlier this year I had to dig these roots out of my garden only to find they are riddled everywhere under the grass  and to this day are growing stronger. Today  as the August deadline comes and goes I will post pictures on here of fresh trees elsewhere on the garden that are openly growing on my lawn! Unbelievable!  Tesco....my question is  do you really think it s my responsibility to manage/cut/dig up trees that belong to you??  After over a year of chat and promises from store manager and HR people in store  plus a visit from the estates team last August 2015  promising to sort the problem within 5 weeks   I am now no further forward. Can somebody at Tesco please help me?	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/14117765_962259733902758_680087553224430498_n.jpg?oh=4f9febcb32bfb0483ff92328ca6d9515&oe=58D66F54	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/14117765_962259733902758_680087553224430498_n.jpg?oh=015949b47b210ac0eb7f8b4700fd42ef&oe=58D77AA3	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=962259733902758&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-01T17:58:50+0000	1472752730	2016-09-01 19:58:50	0	2	0	0	2	2	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I asked for it to be packed without bags.  I made some changes to add some more things to my basket this morning and for some reason it decided to change it to pack with bags????

I parked not close to the store but not miles away with nothing either side of me when I parked up. This is because I m 8 months pregnant and the size of a small whale and my mother who was with me has just four weeks ago had a full knee replacement and is on crutches and struggles getting in and out of the car   my problem is that I m not a mother and baby yet and she s not classed as disabled so we can t park in spaces that are wider.   When I got back to my car someone had parked next to me  which of course they are entitled to do but hadn t left much room at my side to get in the car. We actually saw him park and get out of his car as we walking up to my car and I complained that we had done so well not to have anyone park near us till just then.  Anyway unpacked the trolley and put them away while mum was getting in. In that short time the man had come back to his car and was sat inside. I went to squeeze in with my ginormous belly and my car door just touched his wing mirror  there was no mark at all on his car I literally just touched it and grabbed the door and pulled it to me. I then waved and said sorry through his window to which he got out of his car and came round to check his wing mirror and my car. Proceeded to shout through my car window  which won t actually go down as its broken. And tell me that it s a good job I ve only damaged my own car. I no my cars scratched and bang from myself banging it on my house wall in the wind! So I opened my door and said to him well that s alright then! And he shouted about it would have cost me money and I should be more careful.   And very aggressively got back in his car slammed the door and drove off.  Now him I just find rude and arrogant. I didn t mean to touch his car  he hadn t left space and I did apologise I really didn t even make any sort of mark at all on mine or his car. But in the future what am I supposed to do ?

Does not bode well for quality customer service when a so called  manager can t even personalise an apology letter that s already written for him all he has to do is change my name and store name.   Shame on you tesco  seriously considering swapping supermarkets.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14233090_10153622861921734_315049526711511708_n.jpg?oh=43857c886ca3d6c5033bd2ebe4ac6f3c&oe=591FD6D5	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14233090_10153622861921734_315049526711511708_n.jpg?oh=56f244da17cd53d2c427c70bc76fdfb2&oe=58E9B2C0	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153622861921734&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-01T16:52:03+0000	1472748723	2016-09-01 18:52:03	0	3	2	0	5	3	3	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0

Purchased a beard trimmer on the 01/01/2016 @ 17.56 I have the receipt which advises   Tesco Guarantees all its electrical products for 1 year. If your product develops a fault  please return it to store along with proof of purchase and all accessories for an exchange or refund   I have moved from the area from which I got the trimmer from and went down to my local express store. They advise me that the policy has changed within the last month and they no longer are allowed to do refunds on products they don t have in that particular store. Unfortunately tesco s at the time of the purchase you had the policy in place that I could take it into any store and so therfore you should adhere to that policy that you had in force when I purchased the product.  Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015  goods should be of a satisfactory quality  fit for purpose and as described. My rights have been breached because the item you sold me is faulty.  Phoned customer service up and they have advised that I must go to a bigger store. I have asked them if they will refund the cost of getting a taxi there and back. They are unable to advise me if they can or not. They have advised that I post the product back to head office again unable to advise if they will be able to cover expenses for this.  Manager would not speak to me  he is too busy apparently   Through no fault of my own I have been sold a faulty electrical product and tesco is making it very difficult for me to come to any resolution. I am seeking currently seeking legal advice.					2016-09-01T16:41:44+0000	1472748104	2016-09-01 18:41:44	1	7	1	0	8	6	2	4	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

My daughter is breastfeeding her 4 week old baby. And up til today has been using boots own breast pads with no issues.  However we picked up some of your own brand breast pads yesterday while in your cleethorpes store. She began using them today. Not only does she need to change them pretty much hourly as they are so rubbish. But after rushing to feed her baby  baby started choking. We very quickly held her up and she was sick. Then realised that all around babies mouth and my daughters breast was the inside contents of the breast pad.  As already stated. The breast pads are changed almost hourly due to their poor absorbance. So for them to split and become so hazardous so soon is shocking.					2016-09-01T15:59:30+0000	1472745570	2016-09-01 17:59:30	0	7	0	0	7	7	1	6	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

An hour into my journey I began to tire and pulled over to change my contact lenses for spectacles. Digging into my wash bag for the lens case I managed to slice my thumb on the three bladed razor that I d obviously forgotten to cap safely - blood began pouring everywhere and of course the first aid kit had gone to scout camp with my son and not yet been returned. I saw a Tesco up ahead and even though it was almost 4pm (closing time) I asked if I might be allowed to purchase a box of plasters.   I was taken into the store to the customer service desk  handed a tissue  asked how the injury occurred  received treatment with an alcohol sterilising wipe followed by a plaster and shown to the toilets so I could clean up my arm and change my contacts. I was then offered help in cleaning the blood from the car interior.   This was after closing time on a bank holiday shift; they could ve denied me entry to the store or made me buy plasters for myself  but instead they took me in and tended gently to my wound without a second thought. At no time was I made to feel a nuisance or rushed. I even said you don t have to do all this - to which they replied that they knew they didn t have to  but they wanted to.   This happened at Tesco in Farringdon on Monday 30th Aug 2016 and the man on the door was called Gary  the man at customer services was called Trevor and there was another young man at customer services whose name I didn t get.   Please arrange for these three exceptional members of staff to be rewarded for their wonderful customer service.					2016-09-01T15:42:23+0000	1472744543	2016-09-01 17:42:23	4	3	4	0	7	3	2	1	2	0	4	0	0	0	0	0	0

I bought my son a hudl2 before christmas last year he has only used it for 9 months...I was still within my 12 month guarantee when it broke back in july this year  they took it to be repaired only keeping it for 3 weeks  it cam back with the same problem so i phoned to be told how to reset it  i had to do this 3 times a day then rang again and was told to set it a different way which i did 3 times a day AGAIN...I have now had enough  the gentleman on the phone told me my guarantee was now up and suggested i dont send it back and now had to send a picture of my reiept which i did  then was told send a picture of the port which i did  today i am told i will only have a partial refund as it is over 12 months and when i said i would not accept that and would go to court the lovely lady on the end of the phone said fine take it to court  they kept it for ages  fobbed me off with setting it and i feel it was in order for my guarantee to expire and abrupt on the phone...The problem before the guarantee ran out is the same one after  TESCO i have shopped with you every week for years and so have my family  which we will not be doing so any longer  you should be ashamed of yourselves  i have taken my council to small claims court and won i took my local garage to small claims court and won  i will be taking you to court also  you have lost good customers and upset my son in the process  there is no simple repair or refund with TESCO					2016-09-01T14:06:20+0000	1472738780	2016-09-01 16:06:20	1	7	1	0	8	7	1	6	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I spoke to the manager of the store there on the day Andy and he didn t care either. Head office asked for my contact details and telephone number  which I said I didn t mind being contacted but not any the store manager. No one has bothered to contact me. I ve now asked head office why no one has contacted me to be sent a rude reply saying who do you expect to contact you? I m shocked and think people should know how staff members treat there customers and how head office don t care less when a serious complaint is made!					2016-09-01T13:37:17+0000	1472737037	2016-09-01 15:37:17	1	12	2	0	14	12	8	4	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0

I m 22!) After showing ID she then started loudly discussing my age with another assistant in front of me  repeatedly telling me I look fourteen. The whole thing was ridiculous and incredibly embarrassing/rude. I don t expect to be treated this way - it s the closest petrol station to my house but now I m embarrassed to go back. It s put me in a foul mood - especially as I was filling up to go away on holiday!					2016-09-01T12:48:37+0000	1472734117	2016-09-01 14:48:37	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I have spoken to my local tesco this morning to let them know that an item of my shopping from less than an hour ago was not with me when I arrived home. I have paid for the item and it shows on my receipt and it must have been left At the till point. However brackley tesco have told me that the next customer must have picked them up and there is nothing they can do.  Working as a manager for a major retailer  marks and spencer myself I know that in this case we would happily tell the customer to pop in and collect the item again when they next visit the store. Is this really the best customer service tesco can give?					2016-09-01T11:51:01+0000	1472730661	2016-09-01 13:51:01	2	4	2	0	6	3	2	1	4	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0

After I had a struggle to get out of my gate without injuring myself (good job I did not have a pram with me!) and I saw the delivery man I politely said  would ve been nice to be able to get out of my house a bit easier ...I was rudely shouted at and given a look by the driver as if I was you know what on the bottom of his shoe!?   Not happy at all and has put me off ordering from Tesco if he was going to be delivering it! There was plenty of space around to park safely and not blocking anywhere - this is pure laziness of this driver!  I have more images  the registration and date/time/location of the delivery to make an official complaint about this delivery driver.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14184289_10205458531981006_2337559894035844095_n.jpg?oh=082f49779524559fb001fa46708e1094&oe=58E6A8FA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14184289_10205458531981006_2337559894035844095_n.jpg?oh=d3f6da291d6cb5f6cdc5459b85a6c13f&oe=5918BEF7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205458531981006&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-01T11:15:09+0000	1472728509	2016-09-01 13:15:09	1	14	1	0	15	11	5	6	9	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

However I really would like to praise the driver who delivered my order today. He was very polite and cheerful. I walk with a stick and without my asking he took it straight into the kitchen and put it in easy places to be put away. It s so nice to get this sort of service and it deserves to be recognised �					2016-09-01T11:11:33+0000	1472728293	2016-09-01 13:11:33	1	1	1	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

On going to work this morning I note with growing disappointment that blue gloves and litter were blowing all over the forecourt and into our road (first avenue) again!   Please ensure that this is corrected immediately.   There was staff there but no one seemed bothered that the forecourt was a mess.   This a continuing problem and the bins were out on the forecourt despite your promises that they would be compacted and hidden from view.   If this is not cleared up I will inform the environmental health officer who I believe has already warned your store of the nuisance of rubbish.					2016-09-01T10:36:26+0000	1472726186	2016-09-01 12:36:26	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The substitutions are rare  but sensible. I haven t ever had something not be included in the delivery (a regular occurrence from the other supermarket)  they are always on time and almost every shop over the summer has come with a free sample.   Today  this was included. A little  free gift  from Tesco. I am actually completely impressed by their customer service.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14183896_10153694304571300_4856549636609189608_n.jpg?oh=0886e991e88fc1970113cc44a08a1f57&oe=58DC9CFA	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14183896_10153694304571300_4856549636609189608_n.jpg?oh=4998aacba24446c8723e4d0ae22cd08c&oe=58DCBFF7	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153694304571300&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-01T10:29:04+0000	1472725744	2016-09-01 12:29:04	7	1	7	0	8	1	1	0	1	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	0

Could you please tell me why your tesco store in Chesterfield has free from yoghurts on the shelf with a use by date of 30-8-16 for sale on 31-8-16????? Sadly I only just noticed this today after feeding one to my 4month old baby last night! To say I m angry is an understatement really. Not only is a baby classed as a vulnerable group according to food hygiene  but a baby with allergies is more vulnerable. Your staff have clearly failed to do their job effectively and correctly. I just hope they haven t failed in other foods in the store too.	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/14192587_10154470658419663_4079317613482025010_n.jpg?oh=cbf355302d7622e77ef3f1824ad78f2a&oe=59234F7D	https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/14192587_10154470658419663_4079317613482025010_n.jpg?oh=f2a5df6ea80369f6ef63d22958d27266&oe=58D78C70	https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154470658419663&set=o.112463368812803&type=3	facebook.com	2016-09-01T09:23:36+0000	1472721816	2016-09-01 11:23:36	4	18	10	0	28	18	8	10	8	0	4	0	0	0	0	6	0

The shopping came and I unpacked my potatoes in readiness......imagine my bitter disappointment when I saw the difference in size Tesco had picked me! The first one is a suitable contender for a nice meal for one perhaps with beans and cheese but the second one.....oh 😢.....I don t think I can even get a bean on it or make lunch for one from it. Poor little potato and poor me.....my two dinners for one have become just one and a hungry one now.

For example  1.75L bottles of Classic Coke are included in a Any 2 for £2.00 offer which commenced on 31/08  which  when added to a basket in odd number quantities  which obviously don t qualify for the offer  the basket advises you have not qualified for the offer  but when you add them in even number quantities  the basket charges the full non-offer price  and makes no mention of any offer. Similarly  Andrex Toilet Tissue 9 Roll Aloe Vera are included in a 3 for £10.00 or 2 for £7.50 offer which also commenced on 31/08. However in their case  regrdless of how many packs are added to a basket  all are charged at the full price and no mention of the offer is ever made in any way.					2016-09-01T00:10:07+0000	1472688607	2016-09-01 02:10:07	0	3	0	0	3	3	1	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
